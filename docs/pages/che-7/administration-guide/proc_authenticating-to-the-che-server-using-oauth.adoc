= Authenticating to the {prod-short} server using OAuth

For easy user interaction with third-party services, the {prod-short} server supports OAuth authentication. OAuth tokens are also used for GitHub-related plug-ins.

OAuth authentication has two main flows:

delegated:: Default. Delegates OAuth authentication to {identity-provider} server.
embedded:: Uses built-in {prod-short} server mechanism to communicate with OAuth providers.

To switch between the two implementations, use the `che.oauth.service_mode=__<embedded|delegated>__` configuration property.

The main REST endpoint in the OAuth API is `/api/oauth`, which contains:

* An authentication method, `/authenticate`, that the OAuth authentication flow can start with.
* A callback method, `/callback`, to process callbacks from the provider.
* A token GET method, `/token`, to retrieve the current user's OAuth token.
* A token DELETE method, `/token`, to invalidated the current user's OAuth token.
* A GET method, `/`, to get the list of configured identity providers.
