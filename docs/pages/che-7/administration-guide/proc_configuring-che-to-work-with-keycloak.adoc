= Configuring {prod-short} to work with Keycloak

The deployment script configures Keycloak. It creates a `che-public` client with the following fields:

* *Valid Redirect URIs*: Use this URL to access {prod-short}.
* *Web Origins*

The following are common errors when configuring {prod-short} to work with Keycloak:

*Invalid `redirectURI` error*: occurs when you access {prod-short} at `myhost`, which is an alias, and your original `+CHE_HOST+` is `1.1.1.1`. If this error occurs, go to the Keycloak administration console and ensure that the valid redirect URIs are configured.

*CORS error*: occurs when you have an invalid web origin
