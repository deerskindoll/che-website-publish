= Using Swagger or REST clients to execute queries

The user's {identity-provider} token is used to execute queries to the secured API on the user's behalf through REST clients. A valid token must be attached as the *Request* header or the `?token=$token` query parameter.

Access the {prod-short} Swagger interface at `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}/swagger]`. The user must be signed in through {identity-provider}, so that the access token is included in the *Request* header.
