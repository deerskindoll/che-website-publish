= Authenticating to the {prod-short} server using OpenID

OpenID authentication on the {prod-short} server implies the presence of an external OpenID Connect provider and has the following main steps:

* Authenticate the user through a JWT token that is retrieved from an HTTP request or, in case of a missing or invalid token, redirect the user to the {identity-provider} login page.

* Send authentication tokens in an *Authorization* header. In limited cases, when it is impossible to use the *Authorization* header, the token can be sent in the token query parameter. Example: OAuth authentication initialization.

* Compose an internal `subject` object that represents the current user inside the {prod-short} server code.

NOTE: The only supported and tested OpenID provider is {identity-provider}.

.Procedure

To authenticate to the {prod-short} server using OpenID authentication:

. Request the OpenID settings service where clients can find all the necessary URLs and properties of the OpenId provider, such as `jwks.endpoint`, `token.endpoint`, `logout.endpoint`, `realm.name`, or `client_id` returned in the JSON format.

. The service URL is `{prod-url}/api/keycloak/settings`, and it is only available in the {prod-short} multiuser mode. The presence of the service in the URL confirms that the authentication is enabled in the current deployment.

{
    "che.keycloak.token.endpoint": "http://172.19.20.9:5050/auth/realms/che/protocol/openid-connect/token",
    "che.keycloak.profile.endpoint": "http://172.19.20.9:5050/auth/realms/che/account",
    "che.keycloak.client_id": "che-public",
    "che.keycloak.auth_server_url": "http://172.19.20.9:5050/auth",
    "che.keycloak.password.endpoint": "http://172.19.20.9:5050/auth/realms/che/account/password",
    "che.keycloak.logout.endpoint": "http://172.19.20.9:5050/auth/realms/che/protocol/openid-connect/logout",
    "che.keycloak.realm": "che"
}
----
+
The service allows downloading the JavaScript client library to interact with the provider using the `{prod-url}/api/keycloak/OIDCKeycloak.js` URL.

. Redirect the user to the appropriate provider's login page with all the necessary parameters, including `client_id` and the return redirection path. This can be done with any client library (JS or Java).

. When the user is logged in to the provider, the client side-code is obtained, and the JWT token has validated the token, the creation of the `subject` begins.

The verification of the token signature occurs in two main steps:

. Authentication: The token is extracted from the *Authorization* header or from the `token` query parameter and is parsed using the public key retrieved from the provider. In case of expired, invalid, or malformed tokens, a `403` error is sent to the user. The minimal use of the query parameter is recommended, due to its support limitations or complete removal in upcoming versions. 
+
If the validation is successful, the parsed form of the token is passed to the environment initialization step:

. Environment initialization: The filter extracts data from the JWT token claims, creates the user in the local database if it is not yet present, and constructs the `subject` object and sets it into the per-request *EnvironmentContext* object, which is statically accessible everywhere.
+
If the request was made using only a machine token, the following single authentication filter is used:
+
*org.eclipse.che.multiuser.machine.authentication.server.MachineLoginFilter*: The filter finds the user that the `userId` token belongs to, retrieves the user instance, and sets the principal to the session. The {prod-short} server-to-server requests are performed using a dedicated request factory that signs every request with the current subject token obtained from the `EnvironmentContext` object.

[NOTE]
====
.Providing user-specific data

Since {identity-provider} may store user-specific information (first and last name, phone number, job title), there is a special implementation of the *ProfileDao* that can provide this data to consumers. The implementation is read-only, so users cannot perform create and update operations.

== Obtaining the token from credentials through {identity-provider}

Clients that cannot run JavaScript or other clients (such as command-line clients or Selenium tests) must request the authorization token directly from {identity-provider}.

To obtain the token, send a request to the token endpoint with the username and password credentials. This request can be schematically described as the following cURL request:

[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ curl --data "grant_type=password&client_id=__<client_name>__&username=__<username>__&password=__<password>__" \
  http://<keyckloak_host>:5050/auth/realms/__<realm_name>__/protocol/openid-connect/token
----

The {prod-short} dashboard uses a customized {identity-provider} login page and an authentication mechanism based on `grant_type=authorization_code`. It is a two-step authentication process:

. Logging in and obtaining the authorization code.
. Obtaining the token using this authorization code.

[id="obtaining-the-token-from-openshift-token-through-keycloak_{context}"]
== Obtaining the token from the OpenShift token through {identity-provider}

When {prod-short} is installed on OpenShift using the Operator, and the OpenShift OAuth integration is enabled, as it is by default,
the user's {prod-short} authentication token can be retrieved from the user's OpenShift token.

To retrieve the authentication token from the OpenShift token, send a schematically described cURL request to the OpenShift token endpoint:

[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ curl -X POST -d "client_id=__<client_name>__" \
--data-urlencode "grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange" \
-d "subject_token=__<user_openshift_token>__" \
 -d "subject_issuer=__<openshift_identity_provider_name>__" \
 --data-urlencode "subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token" \
 http://<keyckloak_host>:5050/auth/realms/__<realm_name>__/protocol/openid-connect/token
----

The default values for `_<openshift_identity_provider_name>_` are:

- On OpenShift 3.11: `openshift-v3`
- On OpenShift 4.x: `openshift-v4`

`_<user_openshift_token>_` is the token retrieved by the end-user with the command:
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc whoami --show-token
----

WARNING: Before using this token exchange feature, it is required for an end user to be interactively logged in at least once to the {prod-short} Dashboard using the OpenShift login page. This step is needed to link the OpenShift and {identity-provider} user accounts properly and set the required user profile information.
