= Controller requirements

The Workspace Controller consists of a set of five services running in five distinct containers. The following table presents the default resource requirements of each of these services.

These default values are sufficient when the {prod-short} Workspace Controller manages a small amount of {prod-short} workspaces. For bigger deployments, increase the memory limit. See the link:{site-baseurl}che-7/advanced-configuration-options[Advanced configurations options] article for instructions on how to override the default requests and limits. For example, the hosted version of {prod-short} that runs on link:https://che.openshift.io[che.openshift.io] uses 4{nbsp}GiB.
