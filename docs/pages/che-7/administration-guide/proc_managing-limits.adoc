= Managing limits

[NOTE]
====
Managing limits is restricted to the {prod} system administrator and administrator of the organization.
====

The system configuration defines the default limits. The {prod-short} instance inherit from the limits configured on the underlying platform. The administrator of the organization manages only the limits of its sub-organizations. No resource limits apply to the organization by default. The following are the limits defined by the system administrator:

* *Workspace Cap*: The maximum number of workspaces that can exist in the organization.
* *Running Workspace Cap*: The maximum number of workspaces that can run simultaneously in the organization. +
* *Workspace RAM Cap*: The maximum amount of RAM that a workspace can use in GB.
