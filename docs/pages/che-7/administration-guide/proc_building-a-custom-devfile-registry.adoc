* Adding a new devfile.
* Building the devfiles registry.

    ├── devfile.yaml
    └── meta.yaml
----

. Add valid content in the `devfile.yaml` file. For a detailed description of the devfile format, see the link:{site-baseurl}che-7/making-a-workspace-portable-using-a-devfile[Making a workspace portable using a Devfile] section.

. Ensure that the `meta.yaml` file conforms to the following structure:
