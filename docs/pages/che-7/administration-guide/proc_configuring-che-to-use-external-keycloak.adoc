= Configuring {prod-short} to use an external {identity-provider} installation

By default, {prod-short} installation includes the deployment of a dedicated {identity-provider} instance. However, using an external {identity-provider} is also possible. This option is useful when a user has an existing {identity-provider} instance with already-defined users, for example, a company-wide {identity-provider} server used by several applications.

ifeval::["{project-context}" == "che"]
NOTE: A dedicated {identity-provider} instance is only deployed with {prod-short} installed in multiuser mode.
endif::[]

.Placeholders used in examples
[cols="1,2"]
|===
| `_<provider-realm-name>_`
| Identity provider realm name intended for use by {prod-short}

| `_<auth-base-url>_`
| Base URL of the external {identity-provider} server

.Prerequisites

ifeval::["{project-context}" == "che"]
* This procedure is only applicable to {prod-short} installations done using the {prod-short} Operator. When using the `{prod-cli}` management tool and Helm to install {prod-short}, no supported method is available to use an external {identity-provider} instance.
endif::[]

*  In the administration console of the external installation of {identity-provider}, define a link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#_create-realm[realm] containing the users intended to connect to {prod-short}:
+
image::keycloak/external_keycloak_realm.png[link="{imagesdir}/keycloak/external_keycloak_realm.png"]

* In this `realm`, define an link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#oidc-clients[OIDC client] that {prod-short} will use to authenticate the users. This is an example of such a client with the correct settings:
+
image::keycloak/external_keycloak_public_client.png[link="{imagesdir}/keycloak/external_keycloak_public_client.png"]
+
[NOTE]
====
* {prod-short} only supports `public` OIDC clients. Therefore, selecting the `openid-connect` *Client Protocol* option and the `public` *Access Type* option is recommended.

* The list of *Valid Redirect URIs* must contain at least two URIs related to the {prod-short} server, one using the `http` protocol and the other `https`. These URIs must contain the base URL of the {prod-short} server, followed by `/*` wildcards.

* The list of *Web Origins* must contain at least two URIs related to the {prod-short} server, one using the `http` protocol and the other `https`. These URIs must contain the base URL of the {prod-short} server, without any path after the host.
+
The number of URIs depends on the number of installed product tools.
====

* With {prod-short}
ifeval::["{project-context}" == "che"]
installed on OpenShift
endif::[]
that uses the default OpenShift OAuth support, user authentication relies on the integration of {identity-provider} with OpenShift OAuth. This allows users to log in to {prod-short} with their OpenShift login and have their workspaces created under personal OpenShift namespaces.
+
This requires setting up an OpenShift identity provider ins {identity-provider}. When using an external {identity-provider}, set up the identity provider manually. For instructions, see the appropriate {identity-provider} documentations for either link:{link-identity-provider-documentation-openshift-3}[OpenShift 3] or link:{link-identity-provider-documentation-openshift-4}[OpenShift 4].

* The configured identity provider has the options *Store Tokens* and *Stored Tokens Readable* enabled.


.Procedure

. Set the following properties in the `CheCluster` Custom Resource (CR):

[source, yaml]
----
spec:
  auth:
    externalIdentityProvider: true
    identityProviderURL: <auth-base-url>
    identityProviderRealm: <provider-realm-name>
    identityProviderClientId: <oidc-client-name>
----

. When installing {prod-short}
ifeval::["{project-context}" == "che"]
on OpenShift
endif::[]
with OpenShift OAuth support enabled, set the following properties in the `CheCluster` Custom Resource (CR):
+
[source, yaml]
----
spec:
