The following is a {prod-short} workspace creation flow:

. A user starts a {prod-short} workspace defined by:
+
* An editor (the default is Che-Theia)
* A list of plug-ins (for example, Java and Kubernetes tooling)
* A list of runtime applications

. *wsmaster* retrieves the editor and plug-in metadata from the plug-in registry.
. For every plug-in type, *wsmaster* starts a specific plug-in broker.
. The {prod-short} plug-ins broker transforms the plug-in metadata into a Che Plugin definition. It executes the following steps:
+
.. Downloads a plug-in and extracts its content.
.. Processes the plug-in `meta.yaml` file and sends it back to *wsmaster* in the format of a Che Plugin.

. *wsmaster* starts the editor and the plug-in sidecars.
. The editor loads the plug-ins from the plug-in persistent volume.
