= Exporting the self-signed CA certificate from a {prod-short} deployment

When `{prod-cli}` is used to deploy {prod-short}, it exports a self-signed CA certificate into a `cheCA.crt` file to the current user home directory. To get the certificate, use one of the following two methods:

* Export the certificate using the {prod-cli} command:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {prod-cli} cacert:export
----

* Read the `self-signed-certificate` secret from the {prod-short} namespace:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ oc get secret self-signed-certificate -n {prod-namespace}
----
ifeval::["{project-context}" == "che"]
+
When using Kubernetes, substitute `oc` in the above command with `kubectl`.
