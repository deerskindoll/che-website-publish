|Strategy |Details |Pros |Cons
|*unique* | One PVC per workspace volume or user-defined PVC | Storage isolation | An undefined number of PVs is required
|*per-workspace* | One PVC for one workspace | Easier to manage and control storage compared to unique strategy  | PV count still is not known and depends on workspaces number
|*common (default)* | One PVC for all workspaces in one Kubernetes namespace | Easy to manage and control storage | If PV does not support `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) access mode, workspaces must be in separate Kubernetes namespaces. Or there must not be more than 1 running workspace per namespace at the same time.
