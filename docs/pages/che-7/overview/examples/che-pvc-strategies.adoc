|*common (default)* |
One PVC for all workspaces in one Kubernetes namespace


| Easy to manage and control storage | If PV does not support `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) access mode, the configuration will work only if one or both of the following apply: 
 
* Workspaces are in separate Kubernetes namespaces

* Only one  workspace is running per Kubernetes namespace at the same time. See link:{site-baseurl}che-7/advanced-configuration-options/#configuring-namespace-strategies_advanced-configuration-options[Configuring namespace strategies].
|*per-workspace* |

One PVC for one workspace

| Easier to manage and control storage compared to unique strategy  | PV count is not known and depends on workspaces number
|*unique* |

One PVC per workspace volume or user-defined PVC

| Storage isolation | An undefined number of PVs is required
