[id="workspace-namespaces-configuration_{context}"]
= Workspace namespaces configuration

The Kubernetes namespace where a new workspace Pod is deployed depends on the {prod-short} server configuration. By default, every workspace is deployed in a distinct namespace, but the user can configure the {prod-short} server to deploy all workspaces in one specific namespace. The name of a namespace must be provided as a {prod-short} server configuration property and cannot be changed at runtime.
