== FAQs

**Q**: Where can I see the up-to-date status of the Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat?

**A**: There is a dedicated status page - https://che.statuspage.io/

== Troubleshooting

=== Cannot log into the Hosted Che - Authorization token is missed

To authenticate to https://che.openshift.io, one needs to allow cookies from the `static.developers.redhat.com`.
In case these cookies are blocked (by a browser extension like https://www.eff.org/privacybadger[Privacy Badger]),
authentication fails with the following error:

----
Authorization token is missing

----

Also, note that telemetry is enabled in Hosted Che so Woopra / Segment tracking scripts must be explicitly allowed in case being blocked by a browser extension:

- https://api.segment.io/v1/t 
- https://static.woopra.com/js/w.js

Otherwise, the workspace startup will fail.
