= {prod-short} plug-in registry

The {prod-short} plug-in registry is a service that provides the list of plug-ins and editors for the {prod-short} workspaces. A devfile only references a plug-in that is published in a {prod-short} plug-in registry. It runs in a container and can be deployed wherever wsmaster connects.

For more information about plug-in registry customization, see the link:{site-baseurl}che-7/building-and-running-a-custom-registry-image/#cloning-the-plug-in-registry_cloning-the-registries[Customizing plug-in registry] section.
