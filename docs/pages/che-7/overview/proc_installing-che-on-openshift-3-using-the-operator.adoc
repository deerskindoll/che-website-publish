= Installing {prod-short} on OpenShift 3 using the Operator

This section describes how to install {prod-short} on OpenShift 3 with the CLI management tool using the Operator with SSL (HTTPS) enabled.

As of 2.1.1, SSL/TLS is enabled by default as it is required by the Che-Theia IDE.

.Prerequisites

* A running instance of OpenShift 3.11.
* Administrator rights on this OpenShift 3 instance.
* The `{prod-cli}` management tool is installed. See link:{site-baseurl}che-7/using-the-chectl-management-tool/[Installing the `{prod-cli}` management tool].
* The URL for applications on this OpenShift instance is known as `<OPENSHIFT_APPS_URL>`. See xref:preparing-openshift-3-for-installing-che_{context}[].
*  To apply settings that cannot be set directly by the main {prod-cli} command-line parameters, prepare a YAML file, `configuration.yaml`, containing the configuration options. See link:{site-baseurl}che-7/configuring-the-che-installation[Configuring the {prod-short} installation].

.Procedure

. Log in to OpenShift. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#basic-setup-and-login[Basic Setup and Login].

----
$ {prod-cli} server:start -n _<openshift_namespace>_ 
----

[NOTE]
====
To create the {prod-short} instance on OpenShift clusters that have not been configured with a valid certificate for the routes, run the `{prod-cli}` command with the `--self-signed-cert` flag.
====

.Verification steps

. The output of the previous command ends with:
+
----
Command server:start has completed successfully.
----

. Navigate to the {prod-short} cluster instance: `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}]`. The domain uses _Letâ€™s Encrypt_ ACME certificates.
