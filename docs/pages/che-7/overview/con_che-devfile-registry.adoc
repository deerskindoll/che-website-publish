[id="devfile-registry_{context}"]
= Devfile registry

The {prod-short} devfile registry is a service that provides a list of {prod-short} stacks to create ready-to-use workspaces. This list of stacks is used in the  *Dashboard* -> *Create Workspace* window. The devfile registry runs in a container and can be deployed wherever the user dashboard can connect.

// TODO: add link to "Customizing devfile registry"
