[id="{prod-id-short}-keycloak_{context}"]
= {prod-short} and Keycloak

Keycloak is a prerequisite to configure {prod-short} in multi-user mode. The {prod-short} administrator can choose to connect {prod-short} to an existing Keycloak instance or let the {prod-short} deployment start a new dedicated Keycloak instance.

The {prod-short} server uses Keycloak as an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider to authenticate {prod-short} users and secure access to {prod-short} resources.
