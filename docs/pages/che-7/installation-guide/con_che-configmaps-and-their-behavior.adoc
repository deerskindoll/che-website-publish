= {prod-short} configMaps and their behavior

The following section describes {prod-short} `configMaps` and how they behave.

A link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/builds/setting-up-trusted-ca.html[`configMap`] is provided as an editable file that lists options to customize the {prod-short} environment. Based on the {prod-short} installation method, `configMaps` can be used to customize the working environment. The type of configMaps available in your {prod-short} environment varies based on the method used for installing {prod-short}.

== {prod-short} installed using an Operator

link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/operators/olm-what-operators-are.html[Operators] are software extensions to Kubernetes that use link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/operators/crds/crd-managing-resources-from-crds.html[custom resources] to manage applications and their components.

{prod-short} installed using the Operator provides the user with an automatically generated `configMap` called `che`.

The `che` `configMap` contains the main properties for the {prod-short} server, and is in sync with the information stored in the CheCluster Custom Resource file. User modifications of the `che` `configMap` after installing {prod-short} using the Operator are automatically overwritten by values that the Operator obtains from the `CheCluster` Custom Resource.

To edit the `che` `configMap`, edit the Custom Resource manually.
The `configMap` derives values from the `CheCluster` field. User modifications of the `CheCluster` Custom Resource field cause the Operator to change the attributes of the `che` `configMap` accordingly. The `configMap` changes automatically trigger a restart of the {prod-short} Pod.

To add custom properties to the {prod-short} server, such as environment variables that are not automatically generated in the `che` `configMap` by the Operator, or to override automatically generated properties, the `CheCluster` Custom Resource has a `customCheProperties` field, which expects a map.

For example, to override the default memory limit for workspaces, add the `CHE_WORKSPACE_DEFAULT\__MEMORY__LIMIT__MB` property to `customCheProperties`:

[subs="+attributes"]
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: org.eclipse.che/v1
kind: CheCluster
metadata:
  name: eclipse-che
  namespace: che
spec:
  server:
    cheImageTag: ''
    devfileRegistryImage: ''
    pluginRegistryImage: ''
    tlsSupport: false
    selfSignedCert: false
    customCheProperties:
      CHE_WORKSPACE_DEFAULT__MEMORY__LIMIT__MB: "2048"
  auth:
...
----

Previous versions of the {prod-short} Operator had a configMap named `custom` to fulfill this role. If the {prod-short} Operator finds a `configMap` with the name `custom`, it adds the data it contains into the `customCheProperties` field, redeploys {prod-short}, and deletes the `custom` `configMap`.

== {prod-short} installed using a Helm Chart


A link:https://helm.sh/[Helm Chart] is a Kubernetes extension for defining, installing, and upgrading Kubernetes applications.

When {prod-short} is installed using a Helm Chart, the user configures {prod-short} manually by modifying the `configMap` object. The `configMap` object is called `che` and is generated as an editable template after the installation. To apply manual changes to the `custom` `configMap`, delete the {prod-short} pod to manually restart it. Alternatively, use the following `kubectl` command:

----
$ kubectl rollout restart deployment/che
----

This avoids the downtime associated with deleting a Pod because it deploys and starts a new Pod, and only then deletes the old Pod.
