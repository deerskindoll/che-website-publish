= Upgrading from {prod-short} {prod-prev-ver-major} on OpenShift 4 using the web console

This section describes how to upgrade from {prod-short} {prod-prev-ver} to {prod-short} {prod-ver} on OpenShift 4 using the OpenShift web console. This method is using the Operator from OperatorHub.

.Prerequisites

* An administration account on a running instance of OpenShift 4.

* A running instance of {prod-short} {prod-prev-ver} on this OpenShift 4 instance, deployed using the {prod} {prod-prev-ver} Operator.

.Procedure

. In all running workspaces in the {prod-short} {prod-prev-ver} instance, save and push changes back to the Git repositories.

. Shut down all workspaces in the {prod-short} {prod-prev-ver} instance.

. Open the OpenShift console.

. Navigate to the *Project* containing the {prod} {prod-prev-ver} Operator and instance.

. To uninstall the *{prod} {prod-prev-ver}* Operator, in the left panel, navigate to *Operators > Installed Operators*.

. Click on *{prod} {prod-prev-ver}*.

. Click on the btn:[Actions] button on the top right.

. In the drop-down menu, click on *Uninstall Operator* to uninstall the {prod-short} {prod-prev-ver} Operator.

. Accept the selected option `Also completely remove the Operator from the selected namespace` and click on the btn:[Remove] button.

. Navigate to *Operators > Installed Operators* and verify that the Operator does not appear in the list of installed operators.

. In the left panel, navigate to the *Operators* -> *OperatorHub* section.

. In the *Search by keyword* field, type `{prod}`.

. Click on the *{prod}* tile.

. In the *{prod}* pop-up window, click the btn:[Install] button.

. In the *Install Operator* screen, choose following options and validate:
+
* *Installation mode*: *A specific {orch-namespace} on the cluster*.
* *Installed Namespace*: `{prod-short}`.

. Log into the {prod} instance.

. Select an old workspace and click the btn:[Start] button.

. An error message appears, with a link to the documentation explaining how to migrate a workspace to a devfile.

. For each workspace, create a devfile that represents your workspace. See link:{site-baseurl}che-7/converting-a-che-6-workspace-to-a-devfile[Converting a {prod-short} {prod-prev-ver} workspace to a devfile].

. Use the devfile to start the new workspace. See link:{site-baseurl}che-7/configuring-a-workspace-using-a-devfile[Configuring a workspace using a devfile]
