= Network connectivity in restricted environments

Restricted network environments range from a private subnetwork in a cloud provider to a separate network owned by a company, disconnected from the public Internet. Regardless of the network configuration, {prod-short} works *provided that the Ingress and Routes that are created for {prod-short} components ({prod-id-short}-server, keycloak, devfile-registry, plugin-registry) are accessible from inside the Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.*

Consider the network topology of the environment to determine how best to accomplish this. For example, on a network owned by a company or an organization, the network administrators must ensure that traffic bound from the cluster can be routed to Ingress and Route host names. In other cases, for example, on AWS, create a proxy configuration allowing the traffic to leave the node to reach an external-facing Load Balancer.
