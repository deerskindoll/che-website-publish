= Deploying {prod-short} with support for Git repositories with self-signed certificates

This procedure describes how to configure {prod-short} for deployment with support for Git operations on repositories that use self-signed certificates.

.Prerequisites

* Git version 2 or later
* link:https://helm.sh/[Helm] version 2.15 or higher

.Procedure

[discrete]
== Configuring support for self-signed Git repositories on Kubernetes
. Create a new *configMap* with details about the Git server:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ kubectl create configmap che-git-self-signed-cert --from-file=ca.crt \
  --from-literal=githost=__<host:port>__ -n=che
----
In the command, substitute `_<host:port>_` for the host and port of the HTTPS connection on the Git server (optional).
+
NOTE: When `githost` is not specified, the given certificate is used for all HTTPS repositories.
+
NOTE: The certificate file must be named `ca.crt`.

. Configure the workspace exposure strategy
+
=====
.If {prod-short} is deployed using a link:https://helm.sh/[Helm Chart]
. Clone the https://github.com/eclipse/che[che] project
. Go to `deploy/kubernetes/helm/che` directory
. Update the `global.useGitSelfSignedCerts` property. To do that, add the following option to the `helm upgrade` command:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ helm upgrade che -n che --set global.useGitSelfSignedCerts=true --set global.ingressDomain=__<kubernetes-cluster-domain>__ .
----
<kubernetes-cluster-domain> On Minikube, use `$(minikube ip).nip.io`
=====
+
====
.If {prod-short} is deployed using link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/operators/olm-what-operators-are.html[Operators]
Update the `gitSelfSignedCert` property. To do that, execute:

----
$ kubectl patch checluster eclipse-che -n che --type=json -p '[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/server/gitSelfSignedCert", "value": true}]'
----
====
// TODO
// [discrete]
// == Configuring support for self-signed Git repositories on OpenShift

. Create and start new workspace. Every container used by the workspace mounts a special volume that contains a file with the self-signed certificate. The repository's `.git/config` file contains information about the Git server host (its URL) and the path to the certificate in the `http` section (see Git documentation about link:https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-httpsslCAInfo[git-config]). For example:
+
----
[http "https://10.33.177.118:3000"]
        sslCAInfo = /etc/che/git/cert/ca.crt
