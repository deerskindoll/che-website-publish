= Understanding the `CheCluster` Custom Resource

A default deployment of {prod-short} consist in the application of a parametrized `CheCluster` Custom Resource by the {prod} Operator.

`CheCluster` Custom Resource:: 

* A YAML document describing the configuration of the overall {prod-short} installation.
* Contains sections to configure each component: `auth`, `database`, `server`, `storage`.


Role of the {prod} Operator::

* To translate the `CheCluster` Custom Resource into configuration (ConfigMap) usable by each component of the {prod-short} installation.

Role of {orch-name}::

* To apply the configuration (ConfigMap) for each component.
* To create the necessary Pods.
* When {orch-name} detects a change in the configuration of a component, it restarts the Pods accordingly.
