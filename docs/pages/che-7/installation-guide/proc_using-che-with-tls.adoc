= Using {prod-short} with TLS

Self-signed certificates are certificates that are not signed by a certificate authority (CA), and they do not provide all of the security properties that certificates signed by a CA aim to provide. For instance, when a website owner uses a self-signed certificate to provide HTTPS services, users who visit that website will see a warning in their browser.

After installing {prod-short} on {ocp} with TLS support and a self-signed certificate, a user has to add a self-signed TLS certificate to the browser for each route exposed in {prod-short}. If they do not, the login process will be blocked by the *Authorization token is missed. Click here to reload page* error message.

This section describes how to import a root certificate authority into the browser to use {prod-short} with self-signed TLS certificates.
