[NOTE]
====
Note that the following example describes variations in the usage of the `target-container` annotation in versions 7.14 and 7.15 of {prod}.

.Example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mvn-settings-secret
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: che.eclipse.org
    app.kubernetes.io/component: workspace-secret
...
----
+
Annotations must indicate the given secret is mounted as a file, provide the mount path, and, optionally, specify the name of the container in which the secret is mounted. If there is no target-container annotation, the secret will be mounted into all user containers of the {prod-short} workspace, but this is applicable *_only for the {prod-short} version 7.14_*.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mvn-settings-secret
  annotations:
    che.eclipse.org/target-container: maven
    che.eclipse.org/mount-path: /home/user/.m2/
    che.eclipse.org/mount-as: file
  labels:
...
----
+
*_Since the {prod-short} version 7.15_*, the `target-container` annotation is deprecated and `automount-workspace-secret` annotation with Boolean values is introduced. Its purpose is to define the default secret mounting behavior, with the ability to be overridden in a devfile. The `true` value enables the automatic mounting into all workspace containers. In contrast, the `false` value disables the mounting process until it is explicitly requested in a devfile component using the `automountWorkspaceSecrets:true` property.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mvn-settings-secret
  annotations:
    che.eclipse.org/automount-workspace-secret: 'true'
    che.eclipse.org/mount-path: /home/user/.m2/
    che.eclipse.org/mount-as: file
  labels:
...
----
+
Data of the Kubernetes secret may contain several items, whose names must match the desired file name mounted into the container.

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mvn-settings-secret
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: che.eclipse.org
    app.kubernetes.io/component: workspace-secret
  annotations:
    che.eclipse.org/automount-workspace-secret: 'true'
    che.eclipse.org/mount-path: /home/user/.m2/
    che.eclipse.org/mount-as: file
data:
  settings.xml: __<base64 encoded data content here>__
----
+
This results in a file named `settings.xml` being mounted at the `/home/user/.m2/` path of all workspace containers.
+
The secret-s mount path can be overridden for specific components of the workspace using devfile. To change mount path, an additional volume should be declared in a component of the devfile, with name matching overridden secret name, and desired mount path.

----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
  ...
components:
 - type: dockerimage
   alias: maven
   image: maven:3.11
   volumes:
     - name: <secret-name>
       containerPath: /my/new/path
   ...
----
+
Note that for this kind of overrides, components must declare an alias to be able to distinguish containers which belong to them and apply override path exclusively for those containers.
