= Creating a workspace from the default branch of a Git repository

A {prod-short} workspace can be created by pointing to a devfile that is stored in a Git source repository. The {prod-short} instance then uses the discovered link:https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/devfile.yaml[devfile.yaml] file to build a workspace using the `/f?url=` API.

.Prerequisites
* A running instance of {prod}. To install an instance of {prod}, see link:{site-baseurl}che-7/che-quick-starts/[{prod-short} quick-starts].
* The `devfile.yaml` file in the root folder of a Git repository available over HTTPS. See link:{site-baseurl}che-7/making-a-workspace-portable-using-a-devfile/[Making a workspace portable using a devfile] for detailed information about creating and using devfiles.

.Procedure
Run the workspace by opening the following URL: `{prod-url}/f?url=https://__<GitRepository>__`
