= Che-Theia task types

Two types of tasks exist in a devfile: tasks in the VS Code format and {prod-short} commands. Tasks from the devfile are copied to the configuration file when the workspace is started. Depending on the type of the task, the task is then available for running:

* {prod-short} commands: From the *Terminal* -> *Run Task* menu in the *configured tasks* section, or from the *My Workspace* panel

* Tasks in the VS Code format: From the *Run Tasks* menu

To run the task definitions provided by plug-ins, select the *Terminal* -> *Run Task* menu option. The tasks are placed in the *detected tasks* section.
