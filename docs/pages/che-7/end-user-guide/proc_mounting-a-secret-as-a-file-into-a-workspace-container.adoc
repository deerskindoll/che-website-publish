= Mounting a secret as a file into a workspace container

WARNING: {prod} uses Kubernetes VolumeMount `subPath` feature to mount files into containers. This is supported and enabled by default since Kubernetes v1.15 and OpenShift 4.

This section describes how to mount a secret from the user's namespace as a file in single-workspace or multiple-workspace containers of {prod-short}.

.Prerequisites

* A running instance of {prod}. To install an instance of {prod}, see link:{site-baseurl}che-7/che-quick-starts/[{prod-short} 'quick-starts'].

.Procedure

. Create a new Kubernetes secret in the Kubernetes namespace where a {prod-short} workspace will be created.

* The labels of the secret that is about to be created must match the set of labels configured in `che.workspace.provision.secret.labels` property of {prod-short}. The default labels are:

* `app.kubernetes.io/part-of: che.eclipse.org` 
* `app.kubernetes.io/component: workspace-secret`:
