= Mounting a secret as a file into a workspace container

WARNING: {prod} uses Kubernetes VolumeMount `subPath` feature to mount files into containers. This is supported and enabled by default since Kubernetes v1.15 and OpenShift 4.

This section describes how to mount a secret from the user's namespace as a file in single-workspace or multiple-workspace containers of {prod-short}.

.Prerequisites

* A running instance of {prod}. To install an instance of {prod}, see link:{site-baseurl}che-7/che-quick-starts/[{prod-short} 'quick-starts'].

.Procedure

. Create a new Kubernetes secret in the Kubernetes namespace where a {prod-short} workspace will be created.

* The labels of the secret that is about to be created must match the set of labels configured in `che.workspace.provision.secret.labels` property of {prod-short}. The default labels are:

* `app.kubernetes.io/part-of: che.eclipse.org` 
* `app.kubernetes.io/component: workspace-secret`
+
.Example
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mvn-settings-secret
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: che.eclipse.org
    app.kubernetes.io/component: workspace-secret
...
----

* Annotations must indicate the given secret is mounted as a file, provide the mount path, and, optionally, specify the name of the container in which the secret is mounted. If there is no target-container annotation, the secret will be mounted into all user containers of the {prod-short} workspace.
+
.Example
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mvn-settings-secret
  annotations:
    che.eclipse.org/target-container: maven
    che.eclipse.org/mount-path: /home/user/.m2/
    che.eclipse.org/mount-as: file
  labels:
...
----

* Data of the Kubernetes secret must contain exactly one item, the name of which must match the desired file name mounted into the container.
+
.Example
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mvn-settings-secret
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: che.eclipse.org
    app.kubernetes.io/component: workspace-secret
  annotations:
    che.eclipse.org/target-container: maven
    che.eclipse.org/mount-path: /home/user/.m2/
    che.eclipse.org/mount-as: file
data:
  settings.xml: __<base64 encoded data content here>__
----

This results in a file named `settings.xml` being mounted at the `/home/user/.m2/` path of the user container named `maven`.
