= Disambiguation between stacks and devfiles

This section describes differences between stacks in {prod-short} {prod-prev-ver} and devfiles in {prod-short} {prod-ver}

Starting with {prod-short} {prod-ver}:

* A stack is a pre-configured {prod-short} workspace.
* A devfile is a configuration YAML file that {prod-short} consumes and transforms in a cloud workspace composed of multiple containers.

In {prod-short} {prod-prev-ver}, stacks were defined by a `stacks.json` file that was included with the `che server`.
In contrast, in {prod-short} {prod-ver}, the `stacks.json` file does not exist. Instead, a stack is defined in the devfile registry, which is a separate service. Every single devfile in the registry corresponds to a stack.

Note that in {prod-short} {prod-prev-ver}, stacks and workspaces were defined using two different formats. However, with {prod-short} {prod-ver}, the devfile format is used to define both. Nevertheless, a user opening the user dashboard does not notice any difference: in {prod-short} {prod-ver}, a list of stacks is still present to choose from as a starting point to create a workspace.
