To manage GitHub pull requests, the VS Code GitHub Pull Request plug-in is available in the list of plug-ins of the workspace.


== Using the GitHub Pull Requests plug-in

.Prerequisites

* GitHub OAuth should be configured (see link:{site-baseurl}che-7/configuring-github-oauth/[Configuring GitHub OAuth)].

.Procedure

 . Authenticate by running the *GitHub authenticate* command.
 . You will be redirected to GitHub to authorize {prod-short}.
 . When {prod-short} is authorized, refresh the browser page where {prod-short} is running to update the plug-in with the GitHub token.

Alternatively, manually link:https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line[fetch the GitHub token] and paste it to the plug-in by running the *GitHub Pull Requests: Manually Provide Authentication Response* command.
