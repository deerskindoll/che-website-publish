[id="using-self-signed-certificates-in-nuget-projects_{context}"]
= Using self-signed certificates in NuGet projects

Internal artifact repositories often do not have a self-signed (SSL) certificate signed by an authority that is trusted by default. They are usually signed by an internal company authority or are self-signed. Configure your tools to accept these certificates.

.Procedure

. Obtain the certificate file of a non-standard repository and place it in the `/projects/ssl` file to make it accessible from all your containers.

. Specify the location of the certificate file in the `SSL_CERT_FILE` environment variable in your devfile for the OmniSharp plug-in and for the .NET container.
+
.Example of the devfile:
[source,yaml]
