= Configuring Go to use a non-standard-registry

Athens is a Go module datastore and proxy with many configuration options. It can be configured to act only as a module datastore and not as a proxy. An administrator can upload their Go modules to the Athens datastore and have them available across their Go projects. If a project tries to access a Go module that is not in the Athens datastore, the Go build fails.

* To work with Athens, configure the `GOPROXY` environment variable in the devfile of your CLI container:
