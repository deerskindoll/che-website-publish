= Using a badge to link to workspaces

It is common for code repositories to display badges in their `README` files that describe various aspects of the project, such as its test coverage, latest build status, link to documentation, and other things. For example, the {prod-short} GitHub `README` has the following badges:

image::workspace_button/eclipse_che_badges.png[link="{imagesdir}/workspace_button/eclipse_che_badges.png"]

To make the process of using {prod-short} easier, the following badge is available: image:https://che.openshift.io/factory/resources/factory-contribute.svg[Factory Badge]

Use this badge and link it to a {prod-short} instance to quickly open a developer workspace.


== Including the developer workspace badge in a README

.Procedure

Add a link to your repository in the project `README` file. Using link:https://che.openshift.io[che.openshift.io] as an example {prod-short} host, and a GitHub repository:

----
[![Contribute](https://che.openshift.io/factory/resources/factory-contribute.svg)](https://che.openshift.io/f?url=https://github.com/org/repository)
----

The snippet above creates a badge that opens a developer workspace of the repository at link:https://github.com/org/repository[https://github.com/org/repository] at link:https://che.openshift.io/[che.openshift.io]. To open a workspace in your {prod-short} installation, substitute your URL and repository:

----
[![Contribute](https://che.openshift.io/factory/resources/factory-contribute.svg)](https://your-che-host.com/f?url=https://your-repository-url)
