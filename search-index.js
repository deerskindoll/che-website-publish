To preserve the workspace state in persistent storage while the workspace is stopped, request a Kubernetes PersistentVolume (PV) for the Dev Workspace containers in the Kubernetes cluster of your organization’s Che instance. You can request a PV by using the devfile or a Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC). An example of a PV is the /projects/ directory of a workspace, which is mounted by default for non-ephemeral workspaces. Persistent Volumes come at a cost: attaching a persistent volume slows workspace startup. Starting another, concurrently running workspace with a ReadWriteOnce PV may fail.

Now, with devfiles v2, you use a specific meta-folder rather than the devfile to specify the plug-ins and extensions. Every Che instance has a registry of default plug-ins and extensions. The Che-Theia IDE gets information about these plug-ins and extensions from the registry and installs them. Check this Che registry project for an overview of the default plug-ins, extensions, and source code. An online instance that refreshes after every commit to the main branch, is located here. You can use a different plug-in or extension registry for Che-Theia if you don’t work in air-gapped environment: only the default registry is available there. The plug-in and extension overview for Che-Code Visual Studio Code editor is located in the OpenVSX instance. Air gap is not yet supported for this editor. The easiest way to add a Visual Studio Code extension to a workspace is to add it to the .vscode/extensions.json file. The main advantage of this method is that it works with all supported Che IDEs. If you use the Che-Theia IDE, the extension is installed and configured automatically. If you use a different supported IDE with the Che-Code Visual Studio Code fork, the IDE displays a pop-up with a recommendation to install the extension. Prerequisites You have the .vscode/extensions.json file in the root of the GitHub repository. Procedure Add the extension ID to the .vscode/extensions.json file. Use a . sign to separate the publisher and extension. The following example uses the IDs of Red Hat Visual Studio Code Java extension: { \"recommendations\": [ \"redhat.java\" ] } If the specified set of extension IDs isn’t available in the Che registry, the workspace starts without the extension. You can add extra parameters to a plug-in by modifying the .che/che-theia-plugins.yaml file. These modifications include: Defining the plug-ins for workspace installation. Changing the default memory limit. Overriding default preferences. Define the plug-ins to be installed in the workspace. Prerequisites You have the .che/che-theia-plugins.yaml file in the root of the GitHub repository. Procedure Add the ID of the plug-in to the .che/che-theia-plugins.yaml file. Use the / sign to separate the publisher and plug-in name. The following example uses the IDs of Red Hat Visual Studio Code Java extension: - id: redhat/java/latest Override container settings such as the memory limit. Prerequisites You have the .che/che-theia-plugins.yaml file in the root of the GitHub repository. Procedure Add an override section to the .che/che-theia-plugins.yaml file under the id of the plug-in. Specify the memory limit for the extension. In the following example, Che automatically installs the Red Hat Visual Studio Code Java extension in the Che workspace and increases the memory of the workspace by two gigabytes: - id: redhat/java/latest override: sidecar: memoryLimit: 2Gi Override the default preferences of the Visual Studio Code extension for the workspace. Prerequisites You have the .che/che-theia-plugins.yaml file in the root of the GitHub repository. Procedure Add an override section to the .che/che-theia-plugins.yaml file under the id of the extension. Specify the preferences in the Preferences section. In the following example, Che automatically installs Red Hat Visual Studio Code Java extension in the Che workspace and sets the java.server.launchMode preference to LightWeight: - id: redhat/java/latest override: preferences: java.server.launchMode: LightWeight You can also define the preferences in the .vscode/settings.json file, either by changing the preferences in the UI of your IDE or by adding them to the .vscode/settings.json file: { \"my.preferences\": \"my-value\" } If it’s not possible to add extra files in the GitHub repository, you can define some of the plug-in or extension attributes by inlining them in the devfile. You can use this procedure with both .vscode/extensions.json and .che/che-theia-plugins.yaml file contents. Use .vscode/extensions.json file contents to inline the extension attributes in the devfile. Procedure Add an attributes section to your devfile.yaml file. Add .vscode/extensions.json to the atributes section. Add a | sign after the colon separator. Paste the contents of the .vscode/extensions.json file after the | sign. The following example uses Red Hat Visual Studio Code Java extension attributes: schemaVersion: 2.2.0 metadata: name: my-example attributes: .vscode/extensions.json: | { \"recommendations\": [ \"redhat.java\" ] } Use .che/che-theia-plugins.yaml file contents to inline the plug-in attributes in the devfile.

The most important logs are the theia-ide container and the plug-ins container logs. On the container screen, navigate to the Logs section. This section describes how to detect memory problems related to a plug-in running out of memory. The following are the two most common problems related to a plug-in running out of memory: The plug-in container runs out of memory This can happen during plug-in initialization when the container does not have enough RAM to execute the entrypoint of the image. The user can detect this in the logs of the plug-in container. In this case, the logs contain OOMKilled, which implies that the processes in the container requested more memory than is available in the container. A process inside the container runs out of memory without the container noticing this For example, the Java language server (Eclipse JDT Language Server, started by the vscode-java extension) throws an OutOfMemoryException. This can happen any time after the container is initialized, for example, when a plug-in starts a language server or when a process runs out of memory because of the size of the project it has to handle. To detect this problem, check the logs of the primary process running in the container. For example, to check the log file of Eclipse JDT Language Server for details, see the relevant plug-in-specific sections. This section describes how to log the exchange between Che-Theia and a debug adapter into the Output view. Prerequisites A debug session must be started for the Debug adapters option to appear in the list. Procedure Click File → Settings and then open Preferences.

Open a terminal in the container that is running the Eclipse JDT Language Server plug-in (an example name for the container: vscode-javaxxx). Inside the terminal, run the ps aux | grep jdt command to check if the Eclipse JDT Language Server process is running in the container. If the process is running, the output is: usr/lib/jvm/default-jvm/bin/java --add-modules=ALL-SYSTEM --add-opens java.base/java.util This message also shows the Visual Studio Code Java extension used. If it is not running, the language server has not been started inside the container. Check all logs described in Viewing Che workspaces logs. Procedure If the Eclipse JDT Language Server process is running, check if the language server features are working: Open a Java file and use the hover or autocomplete functionality. In case of an erroneous file, the user sees Java in the Outline view or in the Problems view. Procedure The Eclipse JDT Language Server has its own workspace where it logs errors, information about executed commands, and events. To open this log file, open a terminal in the container that is running the Eclipse JDT Language Server plug-in. You can also view the log file by running the Java: Open Java Language Server log file command. Run cat where PATH_TO_LOG_FILE is /home/theia/.theia/workspace-storage//redhat.java/jdt_ws/.metadata/.log. Procedure To log the LSP messages to the Visual Studio Code Output view, enable tracing by setting the java.trace.server attribute to verbose.

The diagnostic messages are printed into the Debug Console view along with the application output. Other than the general diagnostics, there are XML plug-in specific actions that the user can perform. Procedure Open a terminal in the container named vscode-xml-. Run ps aux | grep java to verify that the XML language server has started. If the process is running, the output is: java ***/org.eclipse.ls4xml-uber.jar` If is not, see the Viewing Che workspaces logs chapter. Procedure Check if the features are enabled. The XML plug-in provides multiple settings that can enable and disable features: xml.format.enabled: Enable the formatter xml.validation.enabled: Enable the validation xml.documentSymbols.enabled: Enable the document symbols To diagnose whether the XML language server is working, create a simple XML element, such as , and confirm that it appears in the Outline panel on the right. If the document symbols do not show, ensure that the xml.documentSymbols.enabled attribute is set to true. If it is true, and there are no symbols, the language server may not be hooked to the editor. If there are document symbols, then the language server is connected to the editor. Ensure that the features that the user needs, are set to true in the settings (they are set to true by default). If any of the features are not working, or not working as expected, file an issue against the Language Server. Procedure To log LSP messages to the Visual Studio Code Output view, enable tracing by setting the xml.trace.server attribute to verbose. Procedure The log from the language server can be found in the plug-in sidecar at /home/theia/.theia/workspace-storage//redhat.vscode-xml/lsp4xml.log. This section describes the YAML plug-in specific actions that the user can perform, in addition to the general diagnostics ones. This section describes how to verify the state of the YAML language server. Procedure Check if the container running the YAML plug-in is running the YAML language server. In the editor, open a terminal in the container that is running the YAML plug-in (an example name of the container: vscode-yaml-). In the terminal, run the ps aux | grep node command. This command searches all the node processes running in the current container. Verify that a command node **/server.js is running. The node **/server.js running in the container indicates that the language server is running. If it is not running, the language server has not started inside the container. In this case, see Viewing Che workspaces logs. Procedure To check the feature flags: Check if the features are enabled. The YAML plug-in provides multiple settings that can enable and disable features, such as: yaml.format.enable: Enables the formatter yaml.validate: Enables validation yaml.hover: Enables the hover function yaml.completion: Enables the completion function To check if the plug-in is working, type the simplest YAML, such as hello: world, and then open the Outline panel on the right side of the editor. Verify if there are any document symbols. If yes, the language server is connected to the editor. If any feature is not working, verify that the settings listed above are set to true (they are set to true by default). If a feature is not working, file an issue against the Language Server. Procedure To log LSP messages to the Visual Studio Code Output view, enable tracing by setting the yaml.trace.server attribute to verbose. Che uses the OmniSharp-Theia plug-in as a remote plug-in. It is located at github.com/redhat-developer/omnisharp-theia-plugin. In case of an issue, report it, or contribute your fix in the repository. This plug-in registers omnisharp-roslyn as a language server and provides project dependencies and language syntax for C# applications. The language server runs on .NET SDK 2.2.105. Procedure To check if the container running the OmniSharp-Theia plug-in is running OmniSharp, execute the ps aux | grep OmniSharp.exe command. If the process is running, the following is an example output: /tmp/theia-unpacked/redhat-developer.che-omnisharp-plugin.0.0.1.zcpaqpczwb.omnisharp_theia_plugin.theia/server/bin/mono /tmp/theia-unpacked/redhat-developer.che-omnisharp-plugin.0.0.1.zcpaqpczwb.omnisharp_theia_plugin.theia/server/omnisharp/OmniSharp.exe If the output is different, the language server has not started inside the container. Check the logs described in Viewing Che workspaces logs. Procedure If the OmniSharp.exe process is running, check if the language server features are working by opening a .cs file and trying the hover or completion features, or opening the Problems or Outline view. Procedure If OmniSharp.exe is running, it logs all information in the Output panel. To view the logs, open the Output view and select C# from the drop-down list. The NetcoredebugOutput plug-in provides the netcoredbg tool. This tool implements the Visual Studio Code Debug Adapter protocol and allows users to debug .NET applications under the .NET Core runtime. The container where the NetcoredebugOutput plug-in is running contains .NET SDK v.2.2.105. Procedure Search for a netcoredbg debug configuration in the launch.json file. Example 1. Sample debug configuration { \"type\": \"netcoredbg\", \"request\": \"launch\", \"program\": \"${workspaceFolder}/bin/Debug//\", \"args\": [], \"name\": \".NET Core Launch (console)\", \"stopAtEntry\": false, \"console\": \"internalConsole\" } Test the autocompletion feature within the braces of the configuration section of the launch.json file. If you can find netcoredbg, the Che-Theia plug-in is correctly initialized. If not, see Viewing Che workspaces logs. This section describes how to view NetcoredebugOutput plug-in logs in the Output panel. Procedure Open the Debug console. Procedure The user can inspect the log output of the sidecar container using the Camel language tools that are stored in the vscode-apache-camel Camel container. To verify the state of the language server: Open a terminal inside the vscode-apache-camel container. Run the ps aux | grep java command. The following is an example language server process: java -jar /tmp/vscode-unpacked/camel-tooling.vscode-apache-camel.latest.euqhbmepxd.camel-tooling.vscode-apache-camel-0.0.14.vsix/extension/jars/language-server.jar If you cannot find it, see Viewing Che workspaces logs. The Camel language server is a SpringBoot application that writes its log to the $\\{java.io.tmpdir}/log-camel-lsp.out file. Typically, $\\{java.io.tmpdir} points to the /tmp directory, so the filename is /tmp/log-camel-lsp.out. Procedure The Camel language server logs are printed in the Output channel named Language Support for Apache Camel. The output channel is created only at the first created log entry on the client side. It may be absent when everything is going well. This section describes how to view Che-Theia IDE logs. Observing Che-Theia editor logs helps to get a better understanding and insight over the plug-ins loaded by the editor. This section describes how to access the Che-Theia editor logs using the OpenShift CLI (command-line interface). Prerequisites Che is deployed in an OpenShift cluster. A workspace is created.

Tuning can reduce this start time. Depending on the options, administrators or users can do the tuning. This section includes several tuning options for starting workspaces faster or improving workspace runtime performance. Caching images with Image Puller Role: Administrator When starting a workspace, Kubernetes pulls the images from the registry. A workspace can include many containers meaning that Kubernetes pulls Pod’s images (one per container). Depending on the size of the image and the bandwidth, it can take a long time. Image Puller is a tool that can cache images on each of Kubernetes nodes. As such, pre-pulling images can improve start times. See Caching images for faster workspace start. Choosing better storage type Role: Administrator and user Every workspace has a shared volume attached. This volume stores the project files, so that when restarting a workspace, changes are still available. Depending on the storage, attach time can take up to a few minutes, and I/O can be slow. Installing offline Role: Administrator Components of Che are OCI images. Set up Eclipse Che in offline mode (air-gap scenario) to reduce any extra download at runtime because everything needs to be available from the beginning. See Installing Che in a restricted environment on OpenShift. Optimizing workspace plug-ins Role: User When selecting various plug-ins, each plug-in can bring its own sidecar container, which is an OCI image. Kubernetes pulls the images of these sidecar containers. Reduce the number of plug-ins, or disable them to see if start time is faster. See also Caching images for faster workspace start. Reducing the number of public endpoints Role: Administrator For each endpoint, Kubernetes is creating Kubernetes Ingress or OpenShift Route objects. Depending on the underlying configuration, this creation can be slow. To avoid this problem, reduce the exposure. For example, to automatically detect a new port listening inside containers and redirect traffic for the processes using a local IP address (127.0.0.1), the Che-Theia IDE plug-in has three optional routes. By reducing the number of endpoints and checking endpoints of all plug-ins, workspace start can be faster. CDN configuration The IDE editor uses a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to serve content. Check that the content uses a CDN to the client (or a local route for offline setup). To check that, open Developer Tools in the browser and check for vendors in the Network tab. vendors..js or editor.main.* should come from CDN URLs. Providing enough CPU resources Plug-ins consume CPU resources. For example, when a plug-in provides IntelliSense features, adding more CPU resources may lead to better performance. Ensure the CPU settings in the devfile definition, devfile.yaml, are correct: apiVersion: 1.0.0 components: - type: chePlugin id: id/of/plug-in cpuLimit: 1360Mi (1) cpuRequest: 100m (2) 1 Specifies the CPU limit for the plug-in. 2 Specifies the CPU request for the plug-in. Providing enough memory Plug-ins consume CPU and memory resources. For example, when a plug-in provides IntelliSense features, collecting data can consume all the memory allocated to the container. Providing more memory to the plug-in can increase performance. Ensure about the correctness of memory settings: in the plug-in definition - meta.yaml file in the devfile definition - devfile.yaml file apiVersion: v2 spec: containers: - image: \"quay.io/my-image\" name: \"vscode-plugin\" memoryLimit: \"512Mi\" (1) extensions: - https://link.to/vsix 1 Specifies the memory limit for the plug-in.

Default http://${CHE_HOST}:${CHE_PORT}/api API service internal network URL. Back-end services should initiate REST communications to Che server with this URL Default NULL Che WebSocket major endpoint. Provides basic communication endpoint for major WebSocket interactions and messaging. Default ws://${CHE_HOST}:${CHE_PORT}/api/websocket Che WebSocket major internal endpoint. Provides basic communication endpoint for major WebSocket interactions and messaging. Default NULL Your projects are synchronized from the Che server into the machine running each workspace. This is the directory in the machine where your projects are placed. Default /projects Defines the directory inside the machine where all the workspace logs are placed. Provide this value into the machine, for example, as an environment variable. This is to ensure that agent developers can use this directory to back up agent logs. Default /workspace_logs Configures environment variable HTTP_PROXY to a specified value in containers powering workspaces. Default empty Configures environment variable HTTPS_PROXY to a specified value in containers powering workspaces. Default empty Configures environment variable NO_PROXY to a specified value in containers powering workspaces. Default empty By default, when users access a workspace with its URL, the workspace automatically starts (if currently stopped). Set this to false to disable this behavior. Default true Workspace threads pool configuration. This pool is used for workspace-related operations that require asynchronous execution, for example, starting and stopping. Possible values are fixed and cached. Default fixed This property is ignored when pool type is different from fixed. It configures the exact size of the pool. When set, the multiplier property is ignored. If this property is not set (0, and placeholders (for example: che-workspace-). In that case, new namespace will be created for each user. Used by OpenShift infra as well to specify a Project. The or placeholder is mandatory. Default -che Defines whether che-server should try to label the workspace namespaces. NOTE: It is strongly recommended to keep the value of this property set to true. If false, the new workspace namespaces will not be labeled automatically and therefore not recognized by the Che operator making some features of DevWorkspaces not working. If false, an administrator is required to label the namespaces manually using the labels specified in che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.labels. If you want to manage the namespaces yourself, make sure to follow https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/stable/administration-guide/provisioning-namespaces-in-advance/. Any additional labels present on the namespace are kept in place and do not affect the functionality. Also note that the the administrator is free to pre-create and label the namespaces manually even if this property is true. No updates to the namespaces are done if they already conform to the labeling requirements. Default true Defines whether che-server should try to annotate the workspace namespaces. Default true List of labels to find namespace that are used for Che Workspaces. They are used to: - find prepared namespace for users in combination with che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.annotations. - actively label namespace with any workspace. NOTE: It is strongly recommended not to change the value of this property because the Che operator relies on these labels and their precise values when reconciling DevWorkspaces. If this configuration is changed, the namespaces will not be automatically recognized by the Che operator as workspace namespaces unless manually labeled as such using the default labels and values. Additional labels on the namespace do not affect the functionality. Default app.kubernetes.io/part-of=che.eclipse.org,app.kubernetes.io/component=workspaces-namespace List of annotations to find namespace prepared for Che users workspaces. Only namespace matching the che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.labels will be matched against these annotations. namespace that matches both che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.labels and che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.annotations will be preferentially used for User’s workspaces. It’s possible to use placeholder to specify the namespace to concrete user. They are used to: - find prepared namespace for users in combination with che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.labels. - actively annotate namespace with any workspace. Default che.eclipse.org/username= Defines Kubernetes Service Account name which should be specified to be bound to all workspaces Pods. the Che Operator that Kubernetes Infrastructure will not create the service account and it should exist. OpenShift infrastructure will check if project is predefined(if che.infra.openshift.project is not empty): - if it is predefined then service account must exist there - if it is 'NULL' or empty string then infrastructure will create new OpenShift project per workspace and prepare workspace service account with needed roles there Default NULL Specifies optional, additional cluster roles to use with the workspace service account. the Che Operator that the cluster role names must already exist, and the Che service account needs to be able to create a Role Binding to associate these cluster roles with the workspace service account. The names are comma separated. This property deprecates che.infra.kubernetes.cluster_role_name. Default NULL Cluster roles to assign to user in his namespace Default NULL Defines wait time that limits the Kubernetes workspace start time. Default 8 Defines the timeout in minutes that limits the period for which Kubernetes Ingress become ready Default 5 If during workspace startup an unrecoverable event defined in the property occurs, stop the workspace immediately rather than waiting until timeout. the Che Operator that this SHOULD NOT include a mere \"Failed\" reason, because that might catch events that are not unrecoverable. A failed container startup is handled explicitly by Che server. Default FailedMount,FailedScheduling,MountVolume.SetUpfailed,Failed to pull image,FailedCreate,ReplicaSetCreateError Defines annotations for ingresses which are used for servers exposing. Value depends on the kind of ingress controller. OpenShift infrastructure ignores this property because it uses Routes rather than Ingresses. the Che Operator that for a single-host deployment strategy to work, a controller supporting URL rewriting has to be used (so that URLs can point to different servers while the servers do not need to support changing the app root). The che.infra.kubernetes.ingress.path.rewrite_transform property defines how the path of the ingress should be transformed to support the URL rewriting and this property defines the set of annotations on the ingress itself that instruct the chosen ingress controller to actually do the URL rewriting, potentially building on the path transformation (if required by the chosen ingress controller). For example for Nginx ingress controller 0.22.0 and later the following value is recommended: {\"ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target\": \"/$1\",\"ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect\": \"false\",\\ \"ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-connect-timeout\": \"3600\",\"ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout\": \"3600\", \"nginx.org/websocket-services\": \"\"} and the che.infra.kubernetes.ingress.path.rewrite_transform should be set to \"%s(.*)\". For nginx ingress controller older than 0.22.0, the rewrite-target should be set to merely / and the path transform to %s (see the che.infra.kubernetes.ingress.path.rewrite_transform property). See the Nginx ingress controller documentation for the explanation of how the ingress controller uses the regular expression available in the ingress path and how it achieves the URL rewriting. Default NULL Defines a recipe on how to declare the path of the ingress that should expose a server. The %s represents the base public URL of the server and is guaranteed to end with a forward slash. This property must be a valid input to the String.format() method and contain exactly one reference to %s. See the description of the che.infra.kubernetes.ingress.annotations_json property to see how these two properties interplay when specifying the ingress annotations and path. If not defined, this property defaults to %s (without the quotes) which means that the path is not transformed in any way for use with the ingress controller. Default NULL Additional labels to add into every Ingress created by Che server to allow clear identification. Default NULL Defines security context for Pods that will be created by Kubernetes Infra This is ignored by OpenShift infra Default NULL Defines security context for Pods that will be created by Kubernetes Infra. A special supplemental group that applies to all containers in a Pod. This is ignored by OpenShift infra. Default NULL Defines grace termination period for Pods that will be created by Kubernetes infrastructures. Default value: 0. It allows to stop Pods quickly and significantly decrease the time required for stopping a workspace. the Che Operator: if terminationGracePeriodSeconds have been explicitly set in Kubernetes recipe it will not be overridden. Default 0 Creates Ingresses with Transport Layer Security (TLS) enabled. In OpenShift infrastructure, Routes will be TLS-enabled. Default false Name of a secret that should be used when creating workspace ingresses with TLS. This property is ignored by OpenShift infrastructure. Default empty Data for TLS Secret that should be used for workspaces Ingresses. cert and key should be encoded with Base64 algorithm. These properties are ignored by OpenShift infrastructure. Default NULL Certificate data for TLS Secret that should be used for workspaces Ingresses. Certificate should be encoded with Base64 algorithm. This property is ignored by OpenShift infrastructure. Default NULL Defines the period with which runtimes consistency checks will be performed. If runtime has inconsistent state then runtime will be stopped automatically. Value must be more than 0 or -1, where -1 means that checks won’t be performed at all. It is disabled by default because there is possible Che Server configuration when Che Server doesn’t have an ability to interact with Kubernetes API when operation is not invoked by user. It DOES work on the following configurations: - workspaces objects are created in the same namespace where Che Server is located; - cluster-admin service account token is mounted to Che Server Pod. It DOES NOT work on the following configurations: - Che Server communicates with Kubernetes API using token from OAuth provider. Default -1 Name of the ConfigMap in Che server namespace with additional CA TLS certificates to be propagated into all user’s workspaces. If the property is set on OpenShift 4 infrastructure, and che.infra.openshift.trusted_ca.dest_configmap_labels includes the config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle=true label, then cluster CA bundle will be propagated too. Default NULL Name of the ConfigMap in a workspace namespace with additional CA TLS certificates. Holds the copy of che.infra.kubernetes.trusted_ca.src_configmap but in a workspace namespace. Content of this ConfigMap is mounted into all workspace containers including plugin brokers. Do not change the ConfigMap name unless it conflicts with the already existing ConfigMap. the Che Operator that the resulting ConfigMap name can be adjusted eventually to make it unique in namespace. The original name would be stored in che.original_name label. Default ca-certs Configures path on workspace containers where the CA bundle should be mounted. Content of ConfigMap specified by che.infra.kubernetes.trusted_ca.dest_configmap is mounted. Default /public-certs Comma separated list of labels to add to the CA certificates ConfigMap in user workspace. See the che.infra.kubernetes.trusted_ca.dest_configmap property. Default empty Comma separated list of labels to add to the CA certificates ConfigMap in user workspace. See che.infra.kubernetes.trusted_ca.dest_configmap property. This default value is used for automatic cluster CA bundle injection in OpenShift 4. Default config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle=true Additional labels to add into every Route created by Che server to allow clear identification. Default NULL The hostname that should be used as a suffix for the workspace routes. For example: Using domain_suffix=, the route resembles: routed3qrtk.. It has to be a valid DNS name. Default NULL Initialize OpenShift project with Che server’s service account if OpenShift OAuth is enabled. Default true Docker image of Che plugin broker app that resolves workspace tools configuration and copies plugins dependencies to a workspace. The Che Operator overrides these images by default. Changing the images here will not have an effect if Che is installed using the Operator. Default quay.io/eclipse/che-plugin-metadata-broker:v3.4.0 Docker image of Che plugin artifacts broker. This broker runs as an init container on the workspace Pod. Its job is to take in a list of plugin identifiers (either references to a plugin in the registry or a link to a plugin meta.yaml) and ensure that the correct .vsix and .theia extensions are downloaded into the /plugins directory, for each plugin requested for the workspace. Default quay.io/eclipse/che-plugin-artifacts-broker:v3.4.0 Configures the default behavior of the plugin brokers when provisioning plugins into a workspace. If set to true, the plugin brokers will attempt to merge plugins when possible: they run in the same sidecar image and do not have conflicting settings. This value is the default setting used when the devfile does not specify the mergePlugins attribute. Default false Docker image of Che plugin broker app that resolves workspace tools configuration and copies plugins dependencies to a workspace Default Always Defines the timeout in minutes that limits the max period of result waiting for plugin broker. Default 3 Workspace plug-ins registry endpoint. Should be a valid HTTP URL. Example: http://che-plugin-registry-eclipse-che.192.168.65.2.nip.io In case Che plug-ins registry is not needed value 'NULL' should be used Default https://che-plugin-registry.prod-preview.openshift.io/v3 Workspace plugins registry internal endpoint. Should be a valid HTTP URL. Example: http://devfile-registry.che.svc.cluster.local:8080 In case Che plug-ins registry is not needed value 'NULL' should be used Default NULL Devfile Registry endpoint.

Should be a valid HTTP URL. Example: http://plugin-registry.che.svc.cluster.local:8080 In case Che plug-ins registry is not needed value 'NULL' should be used Default NULL The configuration property that defines available values for storage types that clients such as the Dashboard should propose to users during workspace creation and update. Available values: - persistent: Persistent Storage slow I/O but persistent. - ephemeral: Ephemeral Storage allows for faster I/O but may have limited storage and is not persistent. - async: Experimental feature: Asynchronous storage is combination of Ephemeral and Persistent storage. Allows for faster I/O and keep your changes, will backup on stop and restore on start workspace. Will work only if: - che.infra.kubernetes.pvc.strategy='common' - che.limits.user.workspaces.run.count=1 - che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.default contains in other cases remove async from the list. Default persistent,ephemeral,async The configuration property that defines a default value for storage type that clients such as the Dashboard should propose to users during workspace creation and update. The async value is an experimental feature, not recommended as default type. Default persistent Configures in which way secure servers will be protected with authentication. Suitable values: - default: jwtproxy is configured in a pass-through mode. Servers should authenticate requests themselves. - jwtproxy: jwtproxy will authenticate requests. Servers will receive only authenticated requests. Default jwtproxy Jwtproxy issuer string, token lifetime, and optional auth page path to route unsigned requests to.

Minimum number of threads that used to process major JSON RPC messages. Default 5 Configuration of queue used to process JSON RPC messages. Default 100000 Port the HTTP server endpoint that would be exposed with Prometheus metrics. Default 8087 Indicates which request origins are allowed. CORS filter on WS Master is turned off by default. Use environment variable \"CHE_CORS_ENABLED=true\" to turn it on. Default * Indicates if it allows processing of requests with credentials (in cookies, headers, TLS client certificates). Default false Editor and plugin which will be used for factories that are created from a remote Git repository which does not contain any Che-specific workspace descriptor Multiple plugins must be comma-separated, for example: pluginFooPublisher/pluginFooName/pluginFooVersion,pluginBarPublisher/pluginBarName/pluginBarVersion Default redhat/vscode-commons/latest Devfile filenames to look on repository-based factories (for example GitHub). Factory will try to locate those files in the order they enumerated in the property. Default devfile.yaml,.devfile.yaml Editor that will be used for factories that are created from a remote Git repository which does not contain any Che-specific workspace descriptor. Default eclipse/che-theia/latest File size limit for the URL fetcher which fetch files from the SCM repository. Default 102400 Additional files which may be present in repository to complement devfile v2, and should be referenced as links to SCM resolver service in factory to retrieve them. Default .che/che-editor.yaml,.che/che-theia-plugins.yaml,.vscode/extensions.json Default Editor that should be provisioned into Devfile if there is no specified Editor Format is editorPublisher/editorName/editorVersion value. NULL or absence of value means that default editor should not be provisioned. Default eclipse/che-theia/latest Default Plug-ins which should be provisioned for Default Editor. All the plugins from this list that are not explicitly mentioned in the user-defined devfile will be provisioned but only when the default editor is used or if the user-defined editor is the same as the default one (even if in different version). Format is comma-separated pluginPublisher/pluginName/pluginVersion values, and URLs. For example: eclipse/che-theia-exec-plugin/0.0.1,eclipse/che-theia-terminal-plugin/0.0.1,https://cdn.pluginregistry.com/vi-mode/meta.yaml If the plugin is a URL, the plugin’s meta.yaml is retrieved from that URL. Default NULL Defines comma-separated list of labels for selecting secrets from a user namespace, which will be mount into workspace containers as a files or environment variables. Only secrets that match ALL given labels will be selected. Default app.kubernetes.io/part-of=che.eclipse.org,app.kubernetes.io/component=workspace-secret Plugin is added in case asynchronous storage feature will be enabled in workspace configuration and supported by environment Default eclipse/che-async-pv-plugin/latest Optionally configures node selector for workspace Pod. Format is comma-separated key=value pairs, for example: disktype=ssd,cpu=xlarge,foo=bar Default NULL Optionally configures tolerations for workspace Pod.

Location of the file with GitLab client id. Default NULL Location of the file with GitLab client secret. Default NULL# System Super Privileged Mode. Grants users with the manageSystem permission additional permissions for getByKey, getByNameSpace, stopWorkspaces, and getResourcesInformation. These are not given to admins by default and these permissions allow admins gain visibility to any workspace along with naming themselves with administrator privileges to those workspaces. Default false Grant system permission for che.admin.name user. If the user already exists it’ll happen on component startup, if not - during the first login when user is persisted in the database. Default admin Workspaces are the fundamental runtime for users when doing development. You can set parameters that limit how workspaces are created and the resources that are consumed. The maximum amount of RAM that a user can allocate to a workspace when they create a new workspace. The RAM slider is adjusted to this maximum value. Default 16gb The length of time in milliseconds that a user is idle with their workspace when the system will suspend the workspace and then stopping it. Idleness is the length of time that the user has not interacted with the workspace, meaning that one of the agents has not received interaction. Leaving a browser window open counts toward idleness. Default 1800000 The length of time in milliseconds that a workspace will run, regardless of activity, before the system will suspend it. Set this property if you want to automatically stop workspaces after a period of time. The default is zero, meaning that there is no run timeout. Default 0 The total amount of RAM that a single user is allowed to allocate to running workspaces. A user can allocate this RAM to a single workspace or spread it across multiple workspaces. Default -1 The maximum number of workspaces that a user is allowed to create. The user will be presented with an error message if they try to create additional workspaces. This applies to the total number of both running and stopped workspaces. Default -1 The maximum number of running workspaces that a single user is allowed to have. If the user has reached this threshold and they try to start an additional workspace, they will be prompted with an error message. The user will need to stop a running workspace to activate another. Default 1 The total amount of RAM that a single organization (team) is allowed to allocate to running workspaces. An organization owner can allocate this RAM however they see fit across the team’s workspaces. Default -1 The maximum number of workspaces that a organization is allowed to own. The organization will be presented an error message if they try to create additional workspaces. This applies to the total number of both running and stopped workspaces. Default -1 The maximum number of running workspaces that a single organization is allowed. If the organization has reached this threshold and they try to start an additional workspace, they will be prompted with an error message. The organization will need to stop a running workspace to activate another. Default -1 Alias of the OpenShift identity provider registered in Keycloak, that should be used to create workspace OpenShift resources in OpenShift namespaces owned by the current Che user. Should be set to NULL if che.infra.openshift.project is set to a non-empty value. See: OpenShift identity provider Default NULL Url to OIDC identity provider server Can be set to NULL only if che.oidc.oidcProvider is used Default http://${CHE_HOST}:5050/auth Internal network service Url to OIDC identity provider server Default NULL The number of seconds to tolerate for clock skew when verifying exp or nbf claims. Default 3 Username claim to be used as user display name when parsing JWT token if not defined the fallback value is 'preferred_username' in Keycloak installations and name in Dex installations. Default NULL Email claim to be used when parsing JWT token. If not defined, the fallback value is 'email'. Default NULL Base URL of an alternate OIDC provider that provides a discovery endpoint as detailed in the following specification Obtaining OpenID Provider Configuration Information Deprecated, use che.oidc.auth_server_url and che.oidc.auth_internal_server_url instead. Default NULL Keycloak realm is used to authenticate users Can be set to NULL only if che.keycloak.oidcProvider is used Default che Keycloak client identifier in che.keycloak.realm to authenticate users in the dashboard, the IDE, and the CLI. Default che-public URL to access OSO OAuth tokens Default NULL URL to access Github OAuth tokens Default NULL Use the OIDC optional nonce feature to increase security. Default true URL to the Keycloak Javascript adapter to use. if set to NULL, then the default used value is ${che.keycloak.auth_server_url}/js/keycloak.js, or /api/keycloak/OIDCKeycloak.js if an alternate oidc_provider is used Default NULL Set to true when using an alternate OIDC provider that only supports fixed redirect Urls This property is ignored when che.keycloak.oidc_provider is NULL Default false Configuration of OAuth Authentication Service that can be used in \"embedded\" or \"delegated\" mode. If set to \"embedded\", then the service work as a wrapper to Che’s OAuthAuthenticator ( as in Single User mode). If set to \"delegated\", then the service will use Keycloak IdentityProvider mechanism. Runtime Exception wii be thrown, in case if this property is not set properly. Default delegated Configuration for enabling removing user from Keycloak server on removing user from Che database. By default it’s disabled. Can be enabled in some special cases when deleting a user in Che database should execute removing related-user from Keycloak. For correct work need to set administrator username ${che.keycloak.admin_username} and password ${che.keycloak.admin_password}. Default false Keycloak administrator username. Will be used for deleting user from Keycloak on removing user from Che database. Make sense only in case ${che.keycloak.cascade_user_removal_enabled} set to 'true' Default NULL Keycloak administrator password. Will be used for deleting user from Keycloak on removing user from Che database. Make sense only in case ${che.keycloak.cascade_user_removal_enabled} set to 'true' Default NULL User name adjustment configuration. Che needs to use the usernames as part of Kubernetes object names and labels and therefore has stricter requirements on their format than the identity providers usually allow (it needs them to be DNS-compliant). The adjustment is represented by comma-separated key-value pairs. These are sequentially used as arguments to the String.replaceAll function on the original username. The keys are regular expressions, values are replacement strings that replace the characters in the username that match the regular expression. The modified username will only be stored in the Che database and will not be advertised back to the identity provider. It is recommended to use DNS-compliant characters as replacement strings (values in the key-value pairs). Example: \\\\=-,@=-at- changes \\ to - and @ to -at- so the username org\\user@com becomes org-user-at-com.

This can mean always returning true, or have more complex checks, for example, returning false when a connection property is missing. destroy() - cleanup method that is run before shutting down the telemetry backend. This method sends the WORKSPACE_STOPPED event. onActivity() - notifies that some activity is still happening for a given user. This is mainly used to send WORKSPACE_INACTIVE events. onEvent() - submits telemetry events to the telemetry server, such as WORKSPACE_USED or WORKSPACE_STARTED. increaseDuration() - increases the duration of a current event rather than sending many events in a small frame of time. The following sections cover: Creating a telemetry server to echo events to standard output. Extending the Che telemetry client and implementing a user’s custom backend. Creating a plugin.yaml file representing a Dev Workspace plug-in for the custom backend. Specifying of a location of a custom plug-in to Che by setting the workspacesDefaultPlugins attribute from the CheCluster custom resource. This document describes the steps required to extend the Che telemetry system to communicate with to a custom backend: Creating a server process that receives events Extending Che libraries to create a backend that sends events to the server Packaging the telemetry backend in a container and deploying it to an image registry Adding a plug-in for your backend and instructing Che to load the plug-in in your Dev Workspaces A finished example of the telemetry backend is available here. For demonstration purposes, this example shows how to create a server that receives events from our telemetry plug-in and writes them to standard output. For production use cases, consider integrating with a third-party telemetry system (for example, Segment, Woopra) rather than creating your own telemetry server. In this case, use your provider’s APIs to send events from your custom backend to their system. The following Go code starts a server on port 8080 and writes events to standard output: Example 1. main.go package main import ( \"io/ioutil\" \"net/http\" \"go.uber.org/zap\" ) var logger *zap.SugaredLogger func event(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) { switch req.Method { case \"GET\": logger.Info(\"GET /event\") case \"POST\": logger.Info(\"POST /event\") } body, err := req.GetBody() if err != nil { logger.With(\"err\", err).Info(\"error getting body\") return } responseBody, err := ioutil.ReadAll(body) if err != nil { logger.With(\"error\", err).Info(\"error reading response body\") return } logger.With(\"body\", string(responseBody)).Info(\"got event\") } func activity(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) { switch req.Method { case \"GET\": logger.Info(\"GET /activity, doing nothing\") case \"POST\": logger.Info(\"POST /activity\") body, err := req.GetBody() if err != nil { logger.With(\"error\", err).Info(\"error getting body\") return } responseBody, err := ioutil.ReadAll(body) if err != nil { logger.With(\"error\", err).Info(\"error reading response body\") return } logger.With(\"body\", string(responseBody)).Info(\"got activity\") } } func main() { log, _ := zap.NewProduction() logger = log.Sugar() http.HandleFunc(\"/event\", event) http.HandleFunc(\"/activity\", activity) logger.Info(\"Added Handlers\") logger.Info(\"Starting to serve\") http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil) } Create a container image based on this code and expose it as a deployment in OpenShift in the eclipse-che namespace. The code for the example telemetry server is available at telemetry-server-example. To deploy the telemetry server, clone the repository and build the container: $ git clone https://github.com/che-incubator/telemetry-server-example $ cd telemetry-server-example $ docker build -t registry/organization/telemetry-server-example:latest . $ docker push registry/organization/telemetry-server-example:latest Both manifest_with_ingress.yaml and manifest_with_route contain definitions for a Deployment and Service. The former also defines a Kubernetes Ingress, while the latter defines an OpenShift Route. In the manifest file, replace the image and host fields to match the image you pushed, and the public hostname of your Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster. Then run: $ kubectl apply -f manifest_with_[ingress|route].yaml -n {prod-namespace} For fast feedback when developing, it is recommended to do development inside a Dev Workspace. This way, you can run the application in a cluster and receive events from the front-end telemetry plug-in.

For more details on how to set configuration properties specific to your backend, see the Quarkus Configuration Reference Guide. Example 5.

Here, the value is set to 4167. spec: template: attributes: workspaceEnv: - name: DEVWORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT value: '4167' Restart the Dev Workspace from the Eclipse Che dashboard. Run the following command within a Dev Workspace’s terminal window to start the application. Use the --settings flag to specify path to the location of the settings.xml file that contains the GitHub access token. $ mvn --settings=settings.xml quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.http.port=${DEVWORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT} The application now receives telemetry events through port 4167 from the front-end plug-in. Verification steps Verify that the following output is logged: INFO [org.ecl.che.inc.AnalyticsManager] (Quarkus Main Thread) No welcome message provided INFO [io.quarkus] (Quarkus Main Thread) devworkspace-telemetry-example-plugin 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT on JVM (powered by Quarkus 2.7.2.Final) started in 0.323s.

The following output should be logged: INFO [io.qua.dep.dev.RuntimeUpdatesProcessor] (Aesh InputStream Reader) Live reload disabled INFO [org.ecl.che.inc.AnalyticsManager] (executor-thread-2) The received event is: Edit Workspace File in Che For the purposes of the example, this method always returns true whenever it is called. Example 7. AnalyticsManager.java @Override public boolean isEnabled() { return true; } It is possible to put more complex logic in isEnabled(). For example, the hosted Che Woopra backend checks that a configuration property exists before determining if the backend is enabled. onEvent() sends the event received by the backend to the telemetry system. For the example application, it sends an HTTP POST payload to the /event endpoint from the telemetry server. For the following example, the telemetry server application is deployed to OpenShift at the following URL: http://little-telemetry-server-che.apps-crc.testing, where apps-crc.testing is the ingress domain name of the OpenShift cluster. Set up the RESTEasy REST Client by creating TelemetryService.java Example 8. TelemetryService.java package org.my.group; import java.util.Map; import javax.ws.rs.Consumes; import javax.ws.rs.POST; import javax.ws.rs.Path; import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType; import javax.ws.rs.core.Response; import org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.inject.RegisterRestClient; @RegisterRestClient public interface TelemetryService { @POST @Path(\"/event\") (1) @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) Response sendEvent(Map payload); } 1 The endpoint to make the POST request to. Specify the base URL for TelemetryService in the src/main/resources/application.properties file: Example 9. application.properties org.my.group.TelemetryService/mp-rest/url=http://little-telemetry-server-che.apps-crc.testing Inject TelemetryService into AnalyticsManager and send a POST request in onEvent() Example 10. AnalyticsManager.java @Dependent @Alternative public class AnalyticsManager extends AbstractAnalyticsManager { @Inject @RestClient TelemetryService telemetryService; ... @Override public void onEvent(AnalyticsEvent event, String ownerId, String ip, String userAgent, String resolution, Map properties) { Map payload = new HashMap(properties); payload.put(\"event\", event); telemetryService.sendEvent(payload); } This sends an HTTP request to the telemetry server and automatically delays identical events for a small period of time. The default duration is 1500 milliseconds. Many telemetry systems recognize event duration. The AbstractAnalyticsManager merges similar events that happen in the same frame of time into one event. This implementation of increaseDuration() is a no-op. This method uses the APIs of the user’s telemetry provider to alter the event or event properties to reflect the increased duration of an event. Example 11. AnalyticsManager.java @Override public void increaseDuration(AnalyticsEvent event, Map properties) {} Set an inactive timeout limit, and use onActivity() to send a WORKSPACE_INACTIVE event if the last event time is longer than the timeout. Example 12. AnalyticsManager.java public class AnalyticsManager extends AbstractAnalyticsManager { ... private long inactiveTimeLimit = 60000 * 3; ... @Override public void onActivity() { if (System.currentTimeMillis() - lastEventTime >= inactiveTimeLimit) { onEvent(WORKSPACE_INACTIVE, lastOwnerId, lastIp, lastUserAgent, lastResolution, commonProperties); } } When destroy() is called, send a WORKSPACE_STOPPED event and shutdown any resources such as connection pools. Example 13. AnalyticsManager.java @Override public void destroy() { onEvent(WORKSPACE_STOPPED, lastOwnerId, lastIp, lastUserAgent, lastResolution, commonProperties); } Running mvn quarkus:dev as described in Running the application within a Dev Workspace and terminating the application with Ctrl+C sends a WORKSPACE_STOPPED event to the server. See the Quarkus documentation for the best instructions to package the application in a container. Build and push the container to a container registry of your choice. Example 14.

Communications of Che components with external services such as proxies, source code repositories, and identity provider might also require TLS. All communications encrypted with TLS require the use of TLS certificates signed by trusted Certificate Authorities (CA). When the certificates used by Che components or by an external service are signed by an untrusted CA, you must import the CA certificate into the Che instance so that every Che component treats the certificates as signed by a trusted CA. You have to do this in the following cases: The underlying Kubernetes cluster uses TLS certificates signed by an untrusted CA. Che server or workspace components connect to external OIDC providers or a Git server that use TLS certificates signed by an untrusted CA. Che uses labeled ConfigMaps in namespace as sources for TLS certificates. The ConfigMaps can have an arbitrary number of keys with a random number of certificates each. When an OpenShift cluster contains cluster-wide trusted CA certificates added through the cluster-wide-proxy configuration, Che Operator detects them and automatically injects them into a ConfigMap. Che automatically labels the ConfigMap with the config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle=\"true\" label. Based on this annotation, OpenShift automatically injects the cluster-wide trusted CA certificates inside the ca-bundle.crt key of ConfigMap. Some Che components require a full certificate chain to trust the endpoint. If the cluster is configured with an intermediate certificate, add the whole chain, including self-signed root, to Che. Certificate files are typically stored as Base64 files, with extensions such as .pem, .crt, .ca-bundle, and others. All Secrets that hold certificate files should use the Base64-encoded certificate rather than binary-encoded certificate. The following procedure is applicable for already installed and running instances and for instances that are to be installed. Prerequisites An active kubectl session with administrative permissions to the destination Kubernetes cluster. See Overview of kubectl. Namespace for Che exists. Che already uses some reserved file names to automatically inject certificates into the ConfigMap, so avoid using the following reserved file names to save your certificates: ca-bundle.crt ca.crt Procedure Save the certificates you need to import to a local file system. A certificate with the introductory phrase BEGIN TRUSTED CERTIFICATE is likely in the PEM TRUSTED CERTIFICATE format, which is not supported by Java. Convert it to the supported CERTIFICATE format with the following command: openssl x509 -in cert.pem -out cert.cer Create a new ConfigMap with the required TLS certificates: $ kubectl create configmap custom-certs --from-file= -n=eclipse-che To apply more than one bundle, add another -from-file=. Alternatively, create another ConfigMap. Label created ConfigMaps with the app.kubernetes.io/part-of=che.eclipse.org and app.kubernetes.io/component=ca-bundle labels: $ kubectl label configmap custom-certs app.kubernetes.io/part-of=che.eclipse.org app.kubernetes.io/component=ca-bundle -n Deploy Che if it hasn’t been deployed before. Otherwise wait until the rollout of Che components finishes. Restart running workspaces for the changes to take effect. If issues occur after adding the certificates, verify the specified values at the Che instance level and workspace level. Verifying imported certificates at the Che instance level In case of a Che Operator deployment, the namespace where the CheCluster is located contains labeled ConfigMaps with the correct content: $ kubectl get cm --selector=app.kubernetes.io/component=ca-bundle,app.kubernetes.io/part-of=che.eclipse.org -n eclipse-che Check the content of ConfigMap by entering: $ kubectl get cm -n eclipse-che -o yaml Che Pod Volumes list contains a volume that uses ca-certs-merged ConfigMap as data-source. To get the list of Volumes of the Che Pod, run: $ kubectl get pod -o json -n eclipse-che | jq .spec.volumes Che mounts certificates in the /public-certs/ folder of the Che server container. To view the list of files in this folder, enter: $ kubectl exec -t -n eclipse-che -- ls /public-certs/ In the Che server logs, there is a line for every certificate added to the Java truststore, including configured Che certificates. View them: $ kubectl logs -n eclipse-che Che server Java truststore contains the certificates. The certificates SHA1 fingerprints are among the list of the SHA1 of the certificates included in the truststore. View the list: $ kubectl exec -t -n eclipse-che -- keytool -list -keystore /home/user/cacerts Your keystore contains 141 entries: + (...)

The new service is part of the Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift offering, and is using Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces, which is built upon Eclipse Che and is optimized for Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat Linux. Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces is the product that is built from the Eclipse Che project. The product is normally two versions behind the project. Red Hat also provides licensing, packaging, and support, so Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces is considered a more stable product than the upstream Eclipse Che project. See About Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces. Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat provides both Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces product-specific, as well as Eclipse Che community devfiles on the \"Get Started\" tab of the User Dashboard. Eclipse Che and Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces share all the features - all the product’s functionality is available in the project and vice versa. However, not all the upstream plug-ins are available in the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces. To use an unsupported plug-in inside the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces, one must explicitly point to the raw meta.yaml of the plug-in from the devfile. Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat has the following usage limits and terms of service: Storage: 10 GB RAM: 7 GB Concurrent workspaces: 1 Number of workspaces: Unlimited Number of projects per workspace: Unlimited Usage time limit: 30 days The account will be active for 30 days. At the end of the active period, the access will be revoked and all the data will be deleted. All existing workspaces will be lost. To start using Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat again, a user must re-register. Maximum time for a running workspace: 8 hours Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat automatically stops workspaces that run more than 8 hours regardless of activity. Workspace idling time: 30 minutes If there are no interactions with the IDE, the workspace will be stopped after 30 minutes. This section describes how to register to Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat. Procedure Navigate to Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift. Register with an existing OpenShift Online, Red Hat Developer Program, or Red Hat Customer Portal account, or create a new Red Hat account.

The action achieves this by listening to pull request events and providing a factory URL by creating a comment, a status check, or both. This factory URL creates a new workspace from the pull request branch on Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat. The Che documentation repository (https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs) is a real-life example where the Try in Web IDE GitHub action helps reviewers quickly test pull requests. Experience the workflow by navigating to a recent pull request and opening a factory URL. Figure 1. Pull request comment created by the Try in Web IDE GitHub action. Clicking the badge opens a new workspace for reviewers to test the pull request. Figure 2. Pull request status check created by the Try in Web IDE GitHub action. Clicking the \"Details\" link opens a new workspace for reviewers to test the pull request. This section describes how to integrate the Try in Web IDE GitHub action to a GitHub repository workflow. Prerequisites A GitHub repository A devfile in the root of the GitHub repository. Procedure In the GitHub repository, create a .github/workflows directory if it does not exist already. Create an example.yml file in the .github/workflows directory with the following content: Example 1. example.yml name: Try in Web IDE example on: pull_request_target: types: [opened] jobs: add-link: runs-on: ubuntu-20.04 steps: - name: Web IDE Pull Request Check id: try-in-web-ide uses: redhat-actions/try-in-web-ide@v1 with: # GitHub action inputs # required github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # optional - defaults to true add_comment: true # optional - defaults to true add_status: true This code snippet creates a workflow named Try in Web IDE example, with a job that runs the v1 version of the redhat-actions/try-in-web-ide community action. The workflow is triggered on the pull_request_target event, on the opened activity type. Optionally configure the activity types from the on.pull_request_target.types field to customize when workflow trigger. Activity types such as reopened and synchronize can be useful. Example 2. Triggering the workflow on both opened and synchronize activity types on: pull_request_target: types: [opened, synchronize] Optionally configure the add_comment and add_status GitHub action inputs within example.yml. These inputs are sent to the Try in Web IDE GitHub action to customize whether comments and status checks are to be made. Providing a devfile in the root directory of the repository is recommended to define the development environment of the workspace created by the factory URL. In this way, the workspace contains everything users need to review pull requests, such as plug-ins, development commands, and other environment setup. The Che documentation repository devfile is an example of a well-defined and effective devfile.","title":"Try in Web IDE GitHub action","component":"docs","version":"7.53.x","name":"try-in-web-ide-github-action","url":"/docs/stable/hosted-che/try-in-web-ide-github-action/","titles":[{"text":"Adding the action to a GitHub repository workflow","hash":"adding-the-action-to-a-github-repository-workflow_che","id":1},{"text":"Providing a devfile","hash":"providing-a-devfile_che","id":2}]},"135":{"id":135,"text":"A centralized developer environment running on Kubernetes or OpenShift.

Weekly meetings Join us in the Che community meeting every Monday. Roadmap See the development roadmap on the wiki. Eclipse Che is a Kubernetes-native IDE and developer collaboration platform. As an open source project, the core goals of Eclipse Che are to: Accelerate project and developer onboarding: As a zero-install development environment that runs in your browser, Eclipse Che makes it easy for anyone to join your team and contribute to a project. Remove inconsistency between developer environments: No more: “But it works on my machine.” Your code works exactly the same way in everyone’s environment. Provide built-in security and enterprise readiness: As Eclipse Che becomes a viable replacement for VDI solutions, it must be secure and it must support enterprise requirements, such as role-based access control and the ability to remove all source code from developer machines. To achieve those core goals, Eclipse Che provides: Workspaces: Container-based developer workspaces providing all the tools and dependencies needed to code, build, test, run, and debug applications. Browser-based IDEs: Bundled browser-based IDEs with language tools, debuggers, terminal, VCS integration, and much more. Extensible platform: Bring your own IDE. Define, configure, and extend the tools that you need for your application by using plug-ins, which are compatible with Visual Studio Code extensions. Enterprise Integration: Multiuser capabilities, including Keycloak for authentication and integration with LDAP or AD. Che defines the workspace to be the project code files and all the dependencies necessary to edit, build, run, and debug them. Che treats the IDE and the development runtime as dependencies of the workspace. These items are embedded and always included with the workspace. This differentiates Che from classical workspace definitions, which may include the project code, but require the developer to bind their IDE to their workstation and use it to provide a runtime locally. Workspaces are isolated from one another and are responsible for managing the lifecycle of their components. Developers using Eclipse Che use their containers directly in their developer workspaces. Che workspaces are Kubernetes or OpenShift Pods, which allow to replicate the application runtimes (and its microservices) used in production and provide a “developer mode” layer on top of those, adding intelligent code completion and IDE tools. Eclipse Che provides browser-based IDEs for its workspaces. The default IDE is built on Theia, and it has the following capabilities: Monaco-based editor: A fast and responsive editor, CodeLens Language Server Protocol: Language tools Debug Adapter Protocol: Debugger tools Command palette: Do everything from your keyboard Task support: Tasks from Visual Studio Code are extended and support Che commands Embedded preview: Preview your application directly from the IDE, including Markdown preview Customizable layout: Adapt the layout using drag-and-drop And more: Outline view, search, Git In Eclipse Che, the IDE is completely decoupled, so that it is possible to plug a different IDE into Che workspaces: It can be based on Eclipse Theia (as it is a framework to build a web IDE), such as Sirius: It can be a completely different solution, such as Jupyter or Eclipse Dirigible: For situations where the default IDE does not cover the use cases of the users or to use a dedicated tool rather than an IDE. Eclipse Che is a great platform to build cloud-native tools, and it provides a strong extensibility model with an enjoyable developer experience for contributors. Eclipse Che is extensible in different ways: Plug-ins to add capabilities to the IDE. Che-Theia plug-ins rely on APIs compatible with Visual Studio Code. Plug-ins are isolated and provide their own dependencies packaged in containers. Stacks to create pre-configured Che workspaces with a dedicated set of tools. Alternative IDEs to provide specialized tools within Eclipse Che. Build your own, based on Eclipse Theia, or pick existing ones such as Jupyter. Marketplace (soon) to easily distribute tools and custom IDEs, which can be tried online, to users and communities. Eclipse Che uses Che-Theia as its default browser-based IDE. Che-Theia provides a framework to build web IDEs. It is built-in TypeScript and gives contributors a programming model that is flexible, relies on state-of-the-art tools protocols, and makes it faster to build new tools. In Eclipse Che, the dependencies needed for the tools running in the user’s workspace are available when needed. This means that a Che-Theia plug-in provides its dependencies, its back-end services (which could be running in a sidecar container connected to the user’s workspace), and the IDE UI extension. Che packages all these elements together, so that the user does not have to configure different tools together. Eclipse Che rationalizes the effort for a contributor who wants to build a plug-in and distribute it to different developer communities and tools. For that purpose, Eclipse Che features a plug-in API compatible with extension points from Visual Studio Code. As a result, it is easy to bring an existing plug-in from Visual Studio Code into Eclipse Che. The main difference is in the way the plug-ins are packaged. On Eclipse Che, plug-ins are delivered with their own dependencies in their own container. An enterprise integration using OpenShift OAuth or Dex. Every Eclipse Che user gets a centralized developer workspace that can be easily defined, administered, and managed. As a Kubernetes-native application, Eclipse Che provides state-of-the-art monitoring and tracing capabilities, integrating with Prometheus and Grafana.

Eclipse Che A developer platform for the cloud that provides an in-browser IDE. Che tools can be extended by adding development services, such as language servers, debug adapters, or editors (IDEs) packaged as containers. Che-Theia The default editor component of a Che workspace. It is a Che-specific customization of the Eclipse Theia editor. Che-Theia can be extended using Che-Theia plug-ins, which are packaged as containers for ease of deployment and use. Che-Theia plug-ins are usually compatible with Visual Studio extensions. Che Workspace A container-based development environment managed by Eclipse Che. Every Che workspace is defined by a devfile. A Che workspace is composed of an editor, runtime and build containers and other development tools running inside containers. Editor A web application that is used as an editor in a workspace. Plugin Plug-ins are services that extend Che workspace capabilities. Che plug-ins are packaged as containers. plug-ins are extensions of an editor or a service running in the container. For example, the Che-Theia editor is compatible with Visual Studio Code extensions. Both Che plug-ins and editors are distributed through the Che plug-ins registry. Workspace A container-based development environment managed by Eclipse Che. Every Che workspace is defined by a devfile. A Che workspace can be composed by an editor, some plug-ins and runtime containers. Workspace runtime containers can be defined as simple container images or as Kubernetes or OpenShift resources. A Che Workspace can be associated with source code projects hosted on a remote CVS server. A Che Workspace can contain the definition of one or more commands such as run, build, or debug. Devfile A workspace configuration template. Devfiles are used to create workspaces in the Dashboard. A devfile includes metadata such as scope, tags, components, description, name, and identification. Visual Studio Code API is one of the plug-in APIs that can be used in Theia. Factory A template that contains the configuration to automate the generation of a new workspace using a factory identifier or a devfile added to the URL of the IDE. Use factories to create replicas of existing workspaces or to automate the provisioning of statically or dynamically defined workspaces.
