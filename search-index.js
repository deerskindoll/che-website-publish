In reverse, if a Kubernetes resource is modified in a user namespace, Che will immediately revert the changes. Procedure Create the ConfigMap below to replicate it to every user namespace.

CHE_WORKSPACE_POD_NODE__SELECTOR=disktype=ssd,cpu=xlarge,[key=value] nodeSelector must be configured during Che installation. This prevents existing workspaces from failing to run due to volumes affinity conflict caused by existing workspace PVC and Pod being scheduled in different zones. To avoid Pods and PVCs to be scheduled in different zones on large, multizone clusters, create an additional StorageClass object (pay attention to the allowedTopologies field), which will coordinate the PVC creation process. Pass the name of this newly created StorageClass to Che through the CHE_INFRA_KUBERNETES_PVC_STORAGE__CLASS__NAME environment variable.

Prerequisites An OpenShift web console session by a cluster administrator. See Accessing the web console. An active oc session with administrative permissions to the OpenShift cluster. See Getting started with the OpenShift CLI. For a repeat installation on the same OpenShift cluster: you uninstalled the previous Che instance according to Uninstalling Che. Procedure In the Administrator view of the OpenShift web console, go to Operators → OperatorHub and search for Eclipse Che. Install the Eclipse Che Operator. See Installing from OperatorHub using the web console. The Eclipse Che Operator depends on the DevWorkspace Operator. If you install the Eclipse Che Operator manually to a non-default namespace, ensure that the DevWorkspace Operator is also installed in the same namespace. This is required as the Operator Lifecycle Manager will attempt to install the DevWorkspace Operator as a dependency within the Eclipse Che Operator namespace, potentially resulting in two conflicting installations of the DevWorkspace Operator if the latter is installed in a different namespace. Create the eclipse-che project in OpenShift as follows: oc create namespace eclipse-che Go to Operators → Installed Operators → Eclipse Che instance Specification → Create CheCluster → YAML view.

By default, logs are downloaded to a temporary directory on the machine. However, this can be overwritten by specifying the -d parameter.

This can mean always returning true, or have more complex checks, for example, returning false when a connection property is missing. destroy() - cleanup method that is run before shutting down the telemetry backend. This method sends the WORKSPACE_STOPPED event. onActivity() - notifies that some activity is still happening for a given user. This is mainly used to send WORKSPACE_INACTIVE events. onEvent() - submits telemetry events to the telemetry server, such as WORKSPACE_USED or WORKSPACE_STARTED. increaseDuration() - increases the duration of a current event rather than sending many events in a small frame of time. The following sections cover: Creating a telemetry server to echo events to standard output. Extending the Che telemetry client and implementing a user’s custom backend. Creating a plugin.yaml file representing a DevWorkspace plugin for the custom backend. Specifying of a location of a custom plugin to Che by setting the workspacesDefaultPlugins attribute from the CheCluster custom resource. This document describes the steps required to extend the Che telemetry system to communicate with to a custom backend: Creating a server process that receives events Extending Che libraries to create a backend that sends events to the server Packaging the telemetry backend in a container and deploying it to an image registry Adding a plugin for your backend and instructing Che to load the plugin in your DevWorkspaces A finished example of the telemetry backend is available here. For demonstration purposes, this example shows how to create a server that receives events from our telemetry plugin and writes them to standard output. For production use cases, consider integrating with a third-party telemetry system (for example, Segment, Woopra) rather than creating your own telemetry server. In this case, use your provider’s APIs to send events from your custom backend to their system. The following Go code starts a server on port 8080 and writes events to standard output: Example 1. main.go package main import ( \"io/ioutil\" \"net/http\" \"go.uber.org/zap\" ) var logger *zap.SugaredLogger func event(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) { switch req.Method { case \"GET\": logger.Info(\"GET /event\") case \"POST\": logger.Info(\"POST /event\") } body, err := req.GetBody() if err != nil { logger.With(\"err\", err).Info(\"error getting body\") return } responseBody, err := ioutil.ReadAll(body) if err != nil { logger.With(\"error\", err).Info(\"error reading response body\") return } logger.With(\"body\", string(responseBody)).Info(\"got event\") } func activity(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) { switch req.Method { case \"GET\": logger.Info(\"GET /activity, doing nothing\") case \"POST\": logger.Info(\"POST /activity\") body, err := req.GetBody() if err != nil { logger.With(\"error\", err).Info(\"error getting body\") return } responseBody, err := ioutil.ReadAll(body) if err != nil { logger.With(\"error\", err).Info(\"error reading response body\") return } logger.With(\"body\", string(responseBody)).Info(\"got activity\") } } func main() { log, _ := zap.NewProduction() logger = log.Sugar() http.HandleFunc(\"/event\", event) http.HandleFunc(\"/activity\", activity) logger.Info(\"Added Handlers\") logger.Info(\"Starting to serve\") http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil) } Create a container image based on this code and expose it as a deployment in OpenShift in the eclipse-che namespace. The code for the example telemetry server is available at telemetry-server-example. To deploy the telemetry server, clone the repository and build the container: $ git clone https://github.com/che-incubator/telemetry-server-example $ cd telemetry-server-example $ docker build -t registry/organization/telemetry-server-example:latest . $ docker push registry/organization/telemetry-server-example:latest Both manifest_with_ingress.yaml and manifest_with_route contain definitions for a Deployment and Service. The former also defines a Kubernetes Ingress, while the latter defines an OpenShift Route. In the manifest file, replace the image and host fields to match the image you pushed, and the public hostname of your Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster. Then run: $ kubectl apply -f manifest_with_[ingress|route].yaml -n eclipse-che For fast feedback when developing, it is recommended to do development inside a DevWorkspace. This way, you can run the application in a cluster and receive events from the front-end telemetry plugin.

For more details on how to set configuration properties specific to your backend, see the Quarkus Configuration Reference Guide. Example 5.

Since org.my.group.AnalyticsManager and org.my.group.MainConfiguration are alternative beans, specify them using the quarkus.arc.selected-alternatives property in src/main/resources/application.properties.

Here, the value is set to 4167. spec: template: attributes: workspaceEnv: - name: DEVWORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT value: '4167' Restart the DevWorkspace from the Eclipse Che dashboard. Run the following command within a DevWorkspace’s terminal window to start the application. Use the --settings flag to specify path to the location of the settings.xml file that contains the GitHub access token. $ mvn --settings=settings.xml quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.http.port=${DEVWORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT} The application now receives telemetry events through port 4167 from the front-end plugin. Verification steps Verify that the following output is logged: INFO [org.ecl.che.inc.AnalyticsManager] (Quarkus Main Thread) No welcome message provided INFO [io.quarkus] (Quarkus Main Thread) devworkspace-telemetry-example-plugin 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT on JVM (powered by Quarkus 2.7.2.Final) started in 0.323s.

The following output should be logged: INFO [io.qua.dep.dev.RuntimeUpdatesProcessor] (Aesh InputStream Reader) Live reload disabled INFO [org.ecl.che.inc.AnalyticsManager] (executor-thread-2) The received event is: Edit Workspace File in Che For the purposes of the example, this method always returns true whenever it is called. Example 7. AnalyticsManager.java @Override public boolean isEnabled() { return true; } It is possible to put more complex logic in isEnabled(). For example, the hosted Che Woopra backend checks that a configuration property exists before determining if the backend is enabled. onEvent() sends the event received by the backend to the telemetry system. For the example application, it sends an HTTP POST payload to the /event endpoint from the telemetry server. For the following example, the telemetry server application is deployed to OpenShift at the following URL: http://little-telemetry-server-che.apps-crc.testing, where apps-crc.testing is the ingress domain name of the OpenShift cluster. Set up the RESTEasy REST Client by creating TelemetryService.java Example 8. TelemetryService.java package org.my.group; import java.util.Map; import javax.ws.rs.Consumes; import javax.ws.rs.POST; import javax.ws.rs.Path; import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType; import javax.ws.rs.core.Response; import org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.inject.RegisterRestClient; @RegisterRestClient public interface TelemetryService { @POST @Path(\"/event\") (1) @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) Response sendEvent(Map payload); } 1 The endpoint to make the POST request to. Specify the base URL for TelemetryService in the src/main/resources/application.properties file: Example 9. application.properties org.my.group.TelemetryService/mp-rest/url=http://little-telemetry-server-che.apps-crc.testing Inject TelemetryService into AnalyticsManager and send a POST request in onEvent() Example 10. AnalyticsManager.java @Dependent @Alternative public class AnalyticsManager extends AbstractAnalyticsManager { @Inject @RestClient TelemetryService telemetryService; ... @Override public void onEvent(AnalyticsEvent event, String ownerId, String ip, String userAgent, String resolution, Map properties) { Map payload = new HashMap(properties); payload.put(\"event\", event); telemetryService.sendEvent(payload); } This sends an HTTP request to the telemetry server and automatically delays identical events for a small period of time. The default duration is 1500 milliseconds. Many telemetry systems recognize event duration. The AbstractAnalyticsManager merges similar events that happen in the same frame of time into one event. This implementation of increaseDuration() is a no-op. This method uses the APIs of the user’s telemetry provider to alter the event or event properties to reflect the increased duration of an event. Example 11. AnalyticsManager.java @Override public void increaseDuration(AnalyticsEvent event, Map properties) {} Set an inactive timeout limit, and use onActivity() to send a WORKSPACE_INACTIVE event if the last event time is longer than the timeout. Example 12. AnalyticsManager.java public class AnalyticsManager extends AbstractAnalyticsManager { ... private long inactiveTimeLimit = 60000 * 3; ... @Override public void onActivity() { if (System.currentTimeMillis() - lastEventTime >= inactiveTimeLimit) { onEvent(WORKSPACE_INACTIVE, lastOwnerId, lastIp, lastUserAgent, lastResolution, commonProperties); } } When destroy() is called, send a WORKSPACE_STOPPED event and shutdown any resources such as connection pools. Example 13. AnalyticsManager.java @Override public void destroy() { onEvent(WORKSPACE_STOPPED, lastOwnerId, lastIp, lastUserAgent, lastResolution, commonProperties); } Running mvn quarkus:dev as described in Running the application within a DevWorkspace and terminating the application with Ctrl+C sends a WORKSPACE_STOPPED event to the server. See the Quarkus documentation for the best instructions to package the application in a container. Build and push the container to a container registry of your choice. Example 14.

To do so, use the che-editor.yaml file. This file supports even a detailed IDE configuration. If you intend to start most or all of your organization’s workspaces with the same IDE other than Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source, an alternative is for the administrator of your organization’s Che instance to specify another supported IDE as the default IDE at the Che instance level. This can be done with .spec.devEnvironments.defaultEditor in the CheCluster Custom Resource. By using the che-editor.yaml file, you can set a common default IDE for your team and provide new contributors with the most suitable IDE for your project source code. You can also use the che-editor.yaml file when you need to set a different IDE default for a particular source code Git repository rather than the default IDE of your organization’s Che instance. Procedure In the remote Git repository of your project source code, create a /.che/che-editor.yaml file with lines that specify the relevant parameter. Verification Start a new workspace with a clone of the Git repository. Verify that the specified IDE loads in the browser tab of the started workspace. The simplest way to select an IDE in the che-editor.yaml is to specify the id of an IDE from the table of supported IDEs: Table 1.

As a result, if there is a workspace named my-workspace in the Che dashboard, there is a corresponding DevWorkspace custom resource named my-workspace in the user’s namespace on the cluster. Because each DevWorkspace custom resource on the cluster represents a Che workspace, you can manage Che workspaces by using Kubernetes APIs with clients such as the command-line kubectl. Each DevWorkspace custom resource contains details derived from the devfile of the Git repository cloned for the workspace. For example, a devfile might provide devfile commands and workspace container configurations. As a user, you can list your workspaces by using the command line.

Users with administrative permissions on the cluster can list all workspaces from all Che users by including the --all-namespaces flag. If your use case does not permit use of the Che dashboard, you can create workspaces with Kubernetes APIs by applying custom resources to the cluster. Creating workspaces through the Che dashboard provides better user experience and configuration benefits compared to using the command line: As a user, you are automatically logged in to the cluster. Kubernetes or OpenShift clients work automatically. Che and its components automatically convert the target Git repository’s devfile into the DevWorkspace and DevWorkspaceTemplate custom resources on the cluster. Access to the workspace is secured by default with the routingClass: che in the DevWorkspace of the workspace. Recognition of the DevWorkspaceOperatorConfig configuration is managed by Che. Recognition of configurations in spec.devEnvironments specified in the CheCluster custom resource including: Persistent storage strategy is specified with devEnvironments.storage. Default IDE is specified with devEnvironments.defaultEditor. Default plugins are specified with devEnvironments.defaultPlugins. Container build configuration is specified with devEnvironments.containerBuildConfiguration.

To preserve the workspace state in persistent storage while the workspace is stopped, request a Kubernetes PersistentVolume (PV) for the DevWorkspace containers in the Kubernetes cluster of your organization’s Che instance. You can request a PV by using the devfile or a Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC). An example of a PV is the /projects/ directory of a workspace, which is mounted by default for non-ephemeral workspaces. Persistent Volumes come at a cost: attaching a persistent volume slows workspace startup. Starting another, concurrently running workspace with a ReadWriteOnce PV might fail.

Tuning can reduce this start time. Depending on the options, administrators or users can do the tuning. This section includes several tuning options for starting workspaces faster or improving workspace runtime performance. Caching images with Image Puller Role: Administrator When starting a workspace, Kubernetes pulls the images from the registry. A workspace can include many containers meaning that Kubernetes pulls Pod’s images (one per container). Depending on the size of the image and the bandwidth, it can take a long time. Image Puller is a tool that can cache images on each of Kubernetes nodes. As such, pre-pulling images can improve start times. See Caching images for faster workspace start. Choosing better storage type Role: Administrator and user Every workspace has a shared volume attached. This volume stores the project files, so that when restarting a workspace, changes are still available. Depending on the storage, attach time can take up to a few minutes, and I/O can be slow. Installing offline Role: Administrator Components of Che are OCI images. Set up Eclipse Che in offline mode to reduce any extra download at runtime because everything needs to be available from the beginning. See Installing Che in a restricted environment on OpenShift. Reducing the number of public endpoints Role: Administrator For each endpoint, Kubernetes is creating Kubernetes Ingress or OpenShift Route objects. Depending on the underlying configuration, this creation can be slow. To avoid this problem, reduce the exposure. For example, to automatically detect a new port listening inside containers and redirect traffic for the processes using a local IP address (127.0.0.1), Microsoft Visual Code - Open Source has three optional routes. By reducing the number of endpoints and checking endpoints of all plugins, workspace start can be faster. Providing enough CPU resources Plugins consume CPU resources. For example, when a plugin provides IntelliSense features, adding more CPU resources can improve performance. Ensure the CPU settings in the devfile definition, devfile.yaml, are correct: components: - name: tools container: image: quay.io/devfile/universal-developer-image:ubi8-latest cpuLimit: 4000m (1) cpuRequest: 1000m (2) 1 Specifies the CPU limit 2 Specifies the CPU request Providing enough memory Plug-ins consume CPU and memory resources. For example, when a plugin provides IntelliSense features, collecting data can consume all the memory allocated to the container. Providing more memory to the container can increase performance. Ensure that memory settings in the devfile definition devfile.yaml file are correct. components: - name: tools container: image: quay.io/devfile/universal-developer-image:ubi8-latest memoryLimit: 6G (1) memoryRequest: 512Mi (2) 1 Specifies the memory limit 2 Specifies the memory request","title":"Troubleshooting slow workspaces","component":"docs","version":"7.81.x","name":"troubleshooting-slow-workspaces","url":"/docs/stable/end-user-guide/troubleshooting-slow-workspaces/","titles":[{"text":"Improving workspace start time","hash":"improving-workspace-start-time","id":1},{"text":"Improving workspace runtime performance","hash":"improving-workspace-runtime-performance","id":2}]},"117":{"id":117,"text":"If you use Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source in a private browsing window, you might encounter the following error message: Error loading webview: Error: Could not register service workers.

The action achieves this by listening to pull request events and providing a factory URL by creating a comment, a status check, or both. This factory URL creates a new workspace from the pull request branch on Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat. The Che documentation repository (https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs) is a real-life example where the Try in Web IDE GitHub action helps reviewers quickly test pull requests. Experience the workflow by navigating to a recent pull request and opening a factory URL. Figure 1. Pull request comment created by the Try in Web IDE GitHub action. Clicking the badge opens a new workspace for reviewers to test the pull request. Figure 2. Pull request status check created by the Try in Web IDE GitHub action. Clicking the \"Details\" link opens a new workspace for reviewers to test the pull request. This section describes how to integrate the Try in Web IDE GitHub action to a GitHub repository workflow. Prerequisites A GitHub repository A devfile in the root of the GitHub repository. Procedure In the GitHub repository, create a .github/workflows directory if it does not exist already.

The workflow is triggered on the pull_request_target event, on the opened activity type. Optionally configure the activity types from the on.pull_request_target.types field to customize when workflow trigger. Activity types such as reopened and synchronize can be useful. Example 2. Triggering the workflow on both opened and synchronize activity types on: pull_request_target: types: [opened, synchronize] Optionally configure the add_comment and add_status GitHub action inputs within example.yml. These inputs are sent to the Try in Web IDE GitHub action to customize whether comments and status checks are to be made. Providing a devfile in the root directory of the repository is recommended to define the development environment of the workspace created by the factory URL.

The format of the git command vary based on the Git Provider. As an example, GitHub personal access token verification can be done using the following command: git clone https://@github.com/username/repo.git Replace with your personal access token, and username/repo with the appropriate repository path. If the token is valid and has the necessary permissions, the cloning process should be successful. Otherwise, this is an indicator of incorrect personal access token, insufficient permissions, or other issues.

The new service is part of the Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift offering, and is using Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces, which is built upon Eclipse Che and is optimized for Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat Linux. Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces is the product that is built from the Eclipse Che project. The product is normally two versions behind the project. Red Hat also provides licensing, packaging, and support, so Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces is considered a more stable product than the upstream Eclipse Che project. See About Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces. Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat provides both Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces product-specific, as well as Eclipse Che community devfiles on the \"Get Started\" tab of the User Dashboard. Eclipse Che and Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces share all the features - all the product’s functionality is available in the project and vice versa. However, not all the upstream plugins are available in the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces. To use an unsupported plugin inside the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces, one must explicitly point to the raw meta.yaml of the plugin from the devfile.

Weekly meetings Join us in the Che community meeting every Monday. Roadmap See the development roadmap on the wiki. Eclipse Che is a Kubernetes-native IDE and developer collaboration platform. As an open source project, the core goals of Eclipse Che are to: Accelerate project and developer onboarding: As a zero-install development environment that runs in your browser, Eclipse Che makes it easy for anyone to join your team and contribute to a project. Remove inconsistency between developer environments: No more: “But it works on my machine.” Your code works exactly the same way in everyone’s environment. Provide built-in security and enterprise readiness: As Eclipse Che becomes a viable replacement for VDI solutions, it must be secure and it must support enterprise requirements, such as role-based access control and the ability to remove all source code from developer machines. To achieve those core goals, Eclipse Che provides: Workspaces: Container-based developer workspaces providing all the tools and dependencies needed to code, build, test, run, and debug applications. Browser-based IDEs: Bundled browser-based IDEs with language tools, debuggers, terminal, VCS integration, and much more. Extensible platform: Bring your own IDE. Define, configure, and extend the tools that you need for your application by using plugins, which are compatible with Visual Studio Code extensions. Enterprise Integration: Multiuser capabilities with OIDC authentication. Che defines the workspace to be the project code files and all the dependencies necessary to edit, build, run, and debug them. Che treats the IDE and the development runtime as dependencies of the workspace. These items are embedded and always included with the workspace. This differentiates Che from classical workspace definitions, which can include the project code, but require the developer to bind their IDE to their workstation and use it to provide a runtime locally. Workspaces are isolated from one another and are responsible for managing the lifecycle of their components. Developers using Eclipse Che use their containers directly in their developer workspaces. Che workspaces are Kubernetes or OpenShift Pods, which allow to replicate the application runtimes (and its microservices) used in production and provide a “developer mode” layer on top of those, adding intelligent code completion and IDE tools. An enterprise integration using OpenShift OAuth or Dex. Every Eclipse Che user gets a centralized developer workspace that can be easily defined, administered, and managed. As a Kubernetes-native application, Eclipse Che provides state-of-the-art monitoring and tracing capabilities, integrating with Prometheus and Grafana.
