Tuning can reduce this start time. Depending on the options, administrators or users can do the tuning. This section includes several tuning options for starting workspaces faster or improving workspace runtime performance. Caching images with Image Puller Role: Administrator When starting a workspace, Kubernetes pulls the images from the registry. A workspace can include many containers meaning that Kubernetes pulls Pod’s images (one per container). Depending on the size of the image and the bandwidth, it can take a long time. Image Puller is a tool that can cache images on each of Kubernetes nodes. As such, pre-pulling images can improve start times. See Caching images for faster workspace start. Choosing better storage type Role: Administrator and user Every workspace has a shared volume attached. This volume stores the project files, so that when restarting a workspace, changes are still available. Depending on the storage, attach time can take up to a few minutes, and I/O can be slow. Installing offline Role: Administrator Components of Che are OCI images. Set up Eclipse Che in offline mode to reduce any extra download at runtime because everything needs to be available from the beginning. See Installing Che in a restricted environment on OpenShift. Optimizing workspace plugins Role: User When selecting various plugins, each plugin can bring its own sidecar container, which is an OCI image. Kubernetes pulls the images of these sidecar containers. Reduce the number of plugins, or disable them to see if start time is faster. See also Caching images for faster workspace start. Reducing the number of public endpoints Role: Administrator For each endpoint, Kubernetes is creating Kubernetes Ingress or OpenShift Route objects. Depending on the underlying configuration, this creation can be slow. To avoid this problem, reduce the exposure. For example, to automatically detect a new port listening inside containers and redirect traffic for the processes using a local IP address (127.0.0.1), the Che-Theia IDE plugin has three optional routes. By reducing the number of endpoints and checking endpoints of all plugins, workspace start can be faster. CDN configuration The IDE editor uses a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to serve content. Check that the content uses a CDN to the client (or a local route for offline setup). To check that, open Developer Tools in the browser and check for vendors in the Network tab. vendors..js or editor.main.* should come from CDN URLs. Providing enough CPU resources Plugins consume CPU resources. For example, when a plugin provides IntelliSense features, adding more CPU resources can improve performance.

Eclipse Che A developer platform for the cloud that provides an in-browser editor (IDE). You can enhance Che tools by adding development services, such as language servers, debug adapters, or IDEs packaged as containers. Visual Studio Code - Open Source The default editor component of a Che workspace. It is a Che-specific customization of the Visual Studio Code editor. You can enhance Visual Studio Code - Open Source with Visual Studio Code extensions. Che Workspace A container-based development environment managed by Eclipse Che. Every Che workspace is defined by a devfile. A Che workspace consists of an editor, runtime and build containers, and other development tools running inside containers. Editor A web application used as an editor in a workspace. Plugin Plugins are services that extend Che workspace capabilities. Che plugins are packaged as containers. Plugins are extensions of an editor or a service running in the container. Both Che plugins and editors are distributed through the Che plugins registry. Workspace A container-based development environment managed by Eclipse Che. Every Che workspace is defined by a devfile. A Che workspace consists of an editor, plugins, and runtime containers. Workspace runtime containers can be defined as simple container images or as Kubernetes or OpenShift resources. A Che workspace can be associated with source code projects hosted on a remote CVS server. A Che workspace can contain the definition of one or more commands such as run, build, or debug. Devfile A workspace configuration template. Use devfiles to create workspaces in the Dashboard. A devfile includes metadata such as scope, tags, components, description, name, and identification. Factory A template that contains the configuration to automate the generation of a new workspace using a factory identifier or a devfile added to the URL of the IDE. Use factories to create replicas of existing workspaces or to automate the provisioning of statically or dynamically defined workspaces. Project A source code repository.","title":"Che Glossary","component":"docs","version":"stable","name":"che-glossary","url":"/docs/stable/glossary/che-glossary/","titles":[{"text":"Naming","hash":"_naming","id":1},{"text":"Terminology","hash":"_terminology","id":2}]},"56":{"id":56,"text":"This section describes procedures to get started with Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat - https://workspaces.openshift.com Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat is an open source product based on Eclipse Che that is running on OpenShift Dedicated. The new service is part of the Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift offering, and is using Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces, which is built upon Eclipse Che and is optimized for Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat Linux. Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces is the product that is built from the Eclipse Che project. The product is normally two versions behind the project. Red Hat also provides licensing, packaging, and support, so Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces is considered a more stable product than the upstream Eclipse Che project. See About Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces. Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat provides both Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces product-specific, as well as Eclipse Che community devfiles on the \"Get Started\" tab of the User Dashboard. Eclipse Che and Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces share all the features - all the product’s functionality is available in the project and vice versa. However, not all the upstream plugins are available in the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces. To use an unsupported plugin inside the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces, one must explicitly point to the raw meta.yaml of the plugin from the devfile.

This can mean always returning true, or have more complex checks, for example, returning false when a connection property is missing. destroy() - cleanup method that is run before shutting down the telemetry backend. This method sends the WORKSPACE_STOPPED event. onActivity() - notifies that some activity is still happening for a given user. This is mainly used to send WORKSPACE_INACTIVE events. onEvent() - submits telemetry events to the telemetry server, such as WORKSPACE_USED or WORKSPACE_STARTED. increaseDuration() - increases the duration of a current event rather than sending many events in a small frame of time. The following sections cover: Creating a telemetry server to echo events to standard output. Extending the Che telemetry client and implementing a user’s custom backend. Creating a plugin.yaml file representing a Dev Workspace plugin for the custom backend. Specifying of a location of a custom plugin to Che by setting the workspacesDefaultPlugins attribute from the CheCluster custom resource. This document describes the steps required to extend the Che telemetry system to communicate with to a custom backend: Creating a server process that receives events Extending Che libraries to create a backend that sends events to the server Packaging the telemetry backend in a container and deploying it to an image registry Adding a plugin for your backend and instructing Che to load the plugin in your Dev Workspaces A finished example of the telemetry backend is available here. For demonstration purposes, this example shows how to create a server that receives events from our telemetry plugin and writes them to standard output. For production use cases, consider integrating with a third-party telemetry system (for example, Segment, Woopra) rather than creating your own telemetry server. In this case, use your provider’s APIs to send events from your custom backend to their system. The following Go code starts a server on port 8080 and writes events to standard output: Example 1. main.go package main import ( \"io/ioutil\" \"net/http\" \"go.uber.org/zap\" ) var logger *zap.SugaredLogger func event(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) { switch req.Method { case \"GET\": logger.Info(\"GET /event\") case \"POST\": logger.Info(\"POST /event\") } body, err := req.GetBody() if err != nil { logger.With(\"err\", err).Info(\"error getting body\") return } responseBody, err := ioutil.ReadAll(body) if err != nil { logger.With(\"error\", err).Info(\"error reading response body\") return } logger.With(\"body\", string(responseBody)).Info(\"got event\") } func activity(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) { switch req.Method { case \"GET\": logger.Info(\"GET /activity, doing nothing\") case \"POST\": logger.Info(\"POST /activity\") body, err := req.GetBody() if err != nil { logger.With(\"error\", err).Info(\"error getting body\") return } responseBody, err := ioutil.ReadAll(body) if err != nil { logger.With(\"error\", err).Info(\"error reading response body\") return } logger.With(\"body\", string(responseBody)).Info(\"got activity\") } } func main() { log, _ := zap.NewProduction() logger = log.Sugar() http.HandleFunc(\"/event\", event) http.HandleFunc(\"/activity\", activity) logger.Info(\"Added Handlers\") logger.Info(\"Starting to serve\") http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil) } Create a container image based on this code and expose it as a deployment in OpenShift in the eclipse-che namespace. The code for the example telemetry server is available at telemetry-server-example. To deploy the telemetry server, clone the repository and build the container: $ git clone https://github.com/che-incubator/telemetry-server-example $ cd telemetry-server-example $ docker build -t registry/organization/telemetry-server-example:latest . $ docker push registry/organization/telemetry-server-example:latest Both manifest_with_ingress.yaml and manifest_with_route contain definitions for a Deployment and Service. The former also defines a Kubernetes Ingress, while the latter defines an OpenShift Route. In the manifest file, replace the image and host fields to match the image you pushed, and the public hostname of your Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster. Then run: $ kubectl apply -f manifest_with_[ingress|route].yaml -n eclipse-che For fast feedback when developing, it is recommended to do development inside a Dev Workspace. This way, you can run the application in a cluster and receive events from the front-end telemetry plugin.

For more details on how to set configuration properties specific to your backend, see the Quarkus Configuration Reference Guide. Example 5. AnalyticsManager.java package org.my.group; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import javax.enterprise.context.Dependent; import javax.enterprise.inject.Alternative; import javax.inject.Inject; import org.eclipse.che.incubator.workspace.telemetry.base.AbstractAnalyticsManager; import org.eclipse.che.incubator.workspace.telemetry.base.AnalyticsEvent; import org.eclipse.che.incubator.workspace.telemetry.finder.DevWorkspaceFinder; import org.eclipse.che.incubator.workspace.telemetry.finder.UsernameFinder; import org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.inject.RestClient; import org.slf4j.Logger; import static org.slf4j.LoggerFactory.getLogger; @Dependent @Alternative public class AnalyticsManager extends AbstractAnalyticsManager { private static final Logger LOG = getLogger(AbstractAnalyticsManager.class); public AnalyticsManager(MainConfiguration mainConfiguration, DevWorkspaceFinder devworkspaceFinder, UsernameFinder usernameFinder) { super(mainConfiguration, devworkspaceFinder, usernameFinder); mainConfiguration.welcomeMessage.ifPresentOrElse( (1) (str) -> LOG.info(\"The welcome message is: {}\", str), () -> LOG.info(\"No welcome message provided\") ); } @Override public boolean isEnabled() { return true; } @Override public void destroy() {} @Override public void onEvent(AnalyticsEvent event, String ownerId, String ip, String userAgent, String resolution, Map properties) { LOG.info(\"The received event is: {}\", event); (2) } @Override public void increaseDuration(AnalyticsEvent event, Map properties) { } @Override public void onActivity() {} } 1 Log the welcome message if it was provided. 2 Log the event received from the front-end plugin. Since org.my.group.AnalyticsManager and org.my.group.MainConfiguration are alternative beans, specify them using the quarkus.arc.selected-alternatives property in src/main/resources/application.properties. Example 6. application.properties quarkus.arc.selected-alternatives=MainConfiguration,AnalyticsManager Set the DEVWORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT environment variable in the Dev Workspace. Here, the value is set to 4167. spec: template: attributes: workspaceEnv: - name: DEVWORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT value: '4167' Restart the Dev Workspace from the Eclipse Che dashboard. Run the following command within a Dev Workspace’s terminal window to start the application. Use the --settings flag to specify path to the location of the settings.xml file that contains the GitHub access token. $ mvn --settings=settings.xml quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.http.port=${DEVWORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT} The application now receives telemetry events through port 4167 from the front-end plugin. Verification steps Verify that the following output is logged: INFO [org.ecl.che.inc.AnalyticsManager] (Quarkus Main Thread) No welcome message provided INFO [io.quarkus] (Quarkus Main Thread) devworkspace-telemetry-example-plugin 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT on JVM (powered by Quarkus 2.7.2.Final) started in 0.323s.

The following output should be logged: INFO [io.qua.dep.dev.RuntimeUpdatesProcessor] (Aesh InputStream Reader) Live reload disabled INFO [org.ecl.che.inc.AnalyticsManager] (executor-thread-2) The received event is: Edit Workspace File in Che For the purposes of the example, this method always returns true whenever it is called. Example 7. AnalyticsManager.java @Override public boolean isEnabled() { return true; } It is possible to put more complex logic in isEnabled(). For example, the hosted Che Woopra backend checks that a configuration property exists before determining if the backend is enabled. onEvent() sends the event received by the backend to the telemetry system. For the example application, it sends an HTTP POST payload to the /event endpoint from the telemetry server. For the following example, the telemetry server application is deployed to OpenShift at the following URL: http://little-telemetry-server-che.apps-crc.testing, where apps-crc.testing is the ingress domain name of the OpenShift cluster. Set up the RESTEasy REST Client by creating TelemetryService.java Example 8. TelemetryService.java package org.my.group; import java.util.Map; import javax.ws.rs.Consumes; import javax.ws.rs.POST; import javax.ws.rs.Path; import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType; import javax.ws.rs.core.Response; import org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.inject.RegisterRestClient; @RegisterRestClient public interface TelemetryService { @POST @Path(\"/event\") (1) @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) Response sendEvent(Map payload); } 1 The endpoint to make the POST request to. Specify the base URL for TelemetryService in the src/main/resources/application.properties file: Example 9. application.properties org.my.group.TelemetryService/mp-rest/url=http://little-telemetry-server-che.apps-crc.testing Inject TelemetryService into AnalyticsManager and send a POST request in onEvent() Example 10. AnalyticsManager.java @Dependent @Alternative public class AnalyticsManager extends AbstractAnalyticsManager { @Inject @RestClient TelemetryService telemetryService; ... @Override public void onEvent(AnalyticsEvent event, String ownerId, String ip, String userAgent, String resolution, Map properties) { Map payload = new HashMap(properties); payload.put(\"event\", event); telemetryService.sendEvent(payload); } This sends an HTTP request to the telemetry server and automatically delays identical events for a small period of time. The default duration is 1500 milliseconds. Many telemetry systems recognize event duration. The AbstractAnalyticsManager merges similar events that happen in the same frame of time into one event. This implementation of increaseDuration() is a no-op. This method uses the APIs of the user’s telemetry provider to alter the event or event properties to reflect the increased duration of an event. Example 11. AnalyticsManager.java @Override public void increaseDuration(AnalyticsEvent event, Map properties) {} Set an inactive timeout limit, and use onActivity() to send a WORKSPACE_INACTIVE event if the last event time is longer than the timeout. Example 12. AnalyticsManager.java public class AnalyticsManager extends AbstractAnalyticsManager { ... private long inactiveTimeLimit = 60000 * 3; ... @Override public void onActivity() { if (System.currentTimeMillis() - lastEventTime >= inactiveTimeLimit) { onEvent(WORKSPACE_INACTIVE, lastOwnerId, lastIp, lastUserAgent, lastResolution, commonProperties); } } When destroy() is called, send a WORKSPACE_STOPPED event and shutdown any resources such as connection pools. Example 13. AnalyticsManager.java @Override public void destroy() { onEvent(WORKSPACE_STOPPED, lastOwnerId, lastIp, lastUserAgent, lastResolution, commonProperties); } Running mvn quarkus:dev as described in Running the application within a Dev Workspace and terminating the application with Ctrl+C sends a WORKSPACE_STOPPED event to the server. See the Quarkus documentation for the best instructions to package the application in a container. Build and push the container to a container registry of your choice. Example 14.

Alternatively, you can add \"version\": \"\" on a new line to specify a version. If the extension is only available from Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace, but not Open VSX, you can ask the extension publisher to also publish it on open-vsx.org according to these instructions, potentially using this GitHub action. If the extension publisher is unavailable or unwilling to publish the extension to open-vsx.org, and if there is no Open VSX equivalent of the extension, consider reporting an issue to the Open VSX team. If you have a closed-source extension or an extension developed only for internal use in your company, you can add the extension directly from a .vsix file by using a URL accessible to your custom plugin registry container: { \"id\": \".\", \"download\": \"\", \"version\": \"\" } Please read the Terms of Use for the Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace before using its resources.

Weekly meetings Join us in the Che community meeting every Monday. Roadmap See the development roadmap on the wiki. Eclipse Che is a Kubernetes-native IDE and developer collaboration platform. As an open source project, the core goals of Eclipse Che are to: Accelerate project and developer onboarding: As a zero-install development environment that runs in your browser, Eclipse Che makes it easy for anyone to join your team and contribute to a project. Remove inconsistency between developer environments: No more: “But it works on my machine.” Your code works exactly the same way in everyone’s environment. Provide built-in security and enterprise readiness: As Eclipse Che becomes a viable replacement for VDI solutions, it must be secure and it must support enterprise requirements, such as role-based access control and the ability to remove all source code from developer machines. To achieve those core goals, Eclipse Che provides: Workspaces: Container-based developer workspaces providing all the tools and dependencies needed to code, build, test, run, and debug applications. Browser-based IDEs: Bundled browser-based IDEs with language tools, debuggers, terminal, VCS integration, and much more. Extensible platform: Bring your own IDE. Define, configure, and extend the tools that you need for your application by using plugins, which are compatible with Visual Studio Code extensions. Enterprise Integration: Multiuser capabilities with OIDC authentication. Che defines the workspace to be the project code files and all the dependencies necessary to edit, build, run, and debug them. Che treats the IDE and the development runtime as dependencies of the workspace. These items are embedded and always included with the workspace. This differentiates Che from classical workspace definitions, which can include the project code, but require the developer to bind their IDE to their workstation and use it to provide a runtime locally. Workspaces are isolated from one another and are responsible for managing the lifecycle of their components. Developers using Eclipse Che use their containers directly in their developer workspaces. Che workspaces are Kubernetes or OpenShift Pods, which allow to replicate the application runtimes (and its microservices) used in production and provide a “developer mode” layer on top of those, adding intelligent code completion and IDE tools. An enterprise integration using OpenShift OAuth or Dex. Every Eclipse Che user gets a centralized developer workspace that can be easily defined, administered, and managed. As a Kubernetes-native application, Eclipse Che provides state-of-the-art monitoring and tracing capabilities, integrating with Prometheus and Grafana.
